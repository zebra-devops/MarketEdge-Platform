# GitHub Issues: Phase 2 - Enhanced Health Check System (HIGH)

## Issue #5: Implement Functional Health Check Endpoints

**Title:** HIGH: Create Functional Health Checks Beyond Basic Server Status

**Labels:** `high-priority`, `monitoring`, `phase-2`, `health-checks`, `functional-testing`

**Priority:** P1 - High (Essential for business-aware monitoring)

**Epic:** 4-Layer Defense Monitoring Architecture

**Description:**
Enhance health check system to validate actual endpoint functionality, not just server availability. Current health checks only verify server is running, not that critical business functionality is working.

**Business Context:**
- **Revenue Protection:** Validates that revenue-generating endpoints actually work
- **Zebra Associates Assurance:** Ensures £925K opportunity endpoints are functional
- **User Experience:** Prevents users from accessing broken functionality
- **SLA Compliance:** Supports uptime guarantees with functional validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `/health/functional` endpoint that tests critical business operations
- [ ] Validate Auth0 authentication endpoints are working
- [ ] Test user management endpoints with mock operations
- [ ] Verify database connectivity and query execution
- [ ] Check feature flag system functionality
- [ ] Validate organization switching for multi-tenant operations
- [ ] Test admin panel endpoint accessibility
- [ ] Include response time validation for critical paths

**Technical Requirements:**
- Extend existing health check system at `/health`
- Add functional test endpoints that don't affect production data
- Implement mock user authentication flow validation
- Add database health checks with read/write operations
- Include third-party service validation (Auth0, Redis if used)
- Add timeout handling for health check operations

**Testing:**
- [ ] Unit tests for each functional health check component
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked external services
- [ ] Test health check behavior under load
- [ ] Verify timeout handling for slow operations
- [ ] Test with various failure scenarios

**Definition of Done:**
- Functional health checks detect actual endpoint failures
- Clear distinction between server health and functional health
- Health checks complete within 5 seconds
- Comprehensive coverage of revenue-critical functionality
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

**Effort Estimate:** 2 days

## Issue #6: Add Business-Critical Path Validation

**Title:** Implement End-to-End Critical Path Health Validation

**Labels:** `high-priority`, `monitoring`, `phase-2`, `critical-path`, `e2e-validation`

**Priority:** P1 - High

**Epic:** 4-Layer Defense Monitoring Architecture

**Description:**
Create comprehensive validation of complete business-critical user journeys to ensure entire workflows are functional.

**Business Context:**
- **Revenue Flow Protection:** Validates complete user journeys that generate revenue
- **Customer Success:** Ensures users can complete critical tasks
- **Business Continuity:** Validates end-to-end workflows remain functional

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Validate complete Auth0 login → dashboard access flow
- [ ] Test organization selection → application access flow
- [ ] Verify admin user creation → invitation → access workflow
- [ ] Check feature flag → application functionality chain
- [ ] Validate multi-tenant data isolation in health checks
- [ ] Test super admin cross-organization access workflow
- [ ] Include performance benchmarks for critical paths

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create synthetic transaction monitoring
- Implement workflow state machines for testing
- Add performance timing for each step
- Include rollback mechanisms for health check operations
- Validate security boundaries during health checks

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test each critical path independently
- [ ] Verify health checks don't affect production state
- [ ] Test performance under various load conditions
- [ ] Validate security during synthetic transactions

**Definition of Done:**
- All revenue-critical workflows validated
- Performance benchmarks established
- Health checks complete without side effects
- Clear reporting of workflow health status

**Effort Estimate:** 2.5 days

## Issue #7: Create Health Check Status API

**Title:** Build Comprehensive Health Status API for External Monitoring

**Labels:** `monitoring`, `phase-2`, `api`, `status-reporting`

**Priority:** P1 - High

**Epic:** 4-Layer Defense Monitoring Architecture

**Description:**
Create comprehensive API for external monitoring systems to query system health status with detailed breakdown of functional components.

**Business Context:**
- **External Integration:** Enables third-party monitoring tools
- **Alerting Foundation:** Provides data for business-aware alerting
- **Stakeholder Visibility:** Offers health status for business stakeholders

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `/api/v1/health/status` endpoint with detailed component health
- [ ] Include startup validation results in health status
- [ ] Add functional health check results
- [ ] Provide performance metrics for critical paths
- [ ] Include dependency status (Auth0, database, external services)
- [ ] Add health trend data (last 24 hours)
- [ ] Support different detail levels (summary, detailed, diagnostic)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Design health status data model
- Implement status aggregation logic
- Add caching for frequently accessed health data
- Include historical health data storage
- Support JSON and Prometheus metrics formats

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test API with various health states
- [ ] Verify performance of status queries
- [ ] Test caching behavior
- [ ] Validate metrics format compliance

**Definition of Done:**
- Comprehensive health status API available
- External monitoring tools can integrate
- Health trends available for analysis
- Multiple output formats supported

**Effort Estimate:** 1.5 days

## Issue #8: Implement Intelligent Health Check Scheduling

**Title:** Add Smart Health Check Scheduling with Failure Recovery

**Labels:** `monitoring`, `phase-2`, `scheduling`, `recovery`

**Priority:** P2 - Medium

**Epic:** 4-Layer Defense Monitoring Architecture

**Description:**
Implement intelligent scheduling for health checks that adapts based on system health and includes automatic recovery verification.

**Business Context:**
- **Resource Optimization:** Prevents health checks from impacting system performance
- **Rapid Problem Detection:** Increases check frequency when issues detected
- **Recovery Validation:** Confirms system recovery after issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement adaptive health check intervals based on system health
- [ ] Increase check frequency when problems detected
- [ ] Add backoff strategy for persistent failures
- [ ] Include recovery verification after failure resolution
- [ ] Support manual health check triggering
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for failing health checks
