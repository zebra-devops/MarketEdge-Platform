# Staging Environment Validation Test

**Created**: September 21, 2025
**Purpose**: Test the new Preview Environment setup

## 🧪 Test Details

This file validates that the staging environment setup works correctly by:

1. **Triggering Preview Environment Creation**: Creating this file on a feature branch should automatically trigger a Render Preview Environment
2. **Testing Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions should validate the configuration
3. **Validating Environment Configuration**: Preview environment should use staging configuration

## 📋 Expected Behavior

When this branch is pushed and a PR is created:

### GitHub Actions Should:
- ✅ Validate render.yaml configuration
- ✅ Run backend tests successfully
- ✅ Validate database migrations
- ✅ Complete security scanning
- ✅ Post PR comment with preview environment details

### Render Should:
- ✅ Automatically create preview environment
- ✅ Deploy with URL: `https://pr-{N}-marketedge-backend.onrender.com`
- ✅ Use staging environment variables (ENVIRONMENT=staging)
- ✅ Create isolated staging database
- ✅ Run database migrations and seeding

### Preview Environment Should Have:
- **Environment**: `staging`
- **Database**: Isolated PostgreSQL with test data
- **Redis**: Isolated Redis instance
- **Auth0**: Staging Auth0 configuration
- **CORS**: Allow all origins (`*`)
- **Logging**: DEBUG level enabled
- **Monitoring**: Sentry disabled

## 🔍 Manual Validation Steps

Once the preview environment is created:

1. **Health Check**: `curl https://pr-{N}-marketedge-backend.onrender.com/health`
2. **API Documentation**: Visit `/api/v1/docs`
3. **Database Validation**: Check test organizations exist
4. **Auth0 Integration**: Test login flow
5. **Admin Access**: Verify super_admin endpoints work

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This test passes when:
- Preview environment deploys successfully
- All endpoints respond correctly
- Database contains staging test data
- Auth0 integration works with staging configuration
- Admin functionality accessible
