CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYMENT - Matt.Lindop Admin Access
=================================================

Business Impact: Â£925K Zebra Associates opportunity
User: matt.lindop@zebra.associates
Issue: Frontend admin portal only accepted 'admin' role, not 'super_admin'

CHANGES MADE:
1. Updated useEffect role check to accept both 'admin' and 'super_admin'
2. Updated main role validation logic
3. Updated error messages to show both required roles
4. Added distinctive badge styling for super_admin users

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

Frontend (Vercel):
1. The changes are in the frontend code
2. Push to main branch to trigger Vercel deployment
3. Verify deployment completes successfully

Testing Steps:
1. Have Matt.Lindop clear browser cache completely
2. Have Matt.Lindop logout completely from the platform
3. Have Matt.Lindop login again with Auth0
4. Navigate to /admin - should now work

Expected Results:
- Matt.Lindop can access admin portal
- Badge shows "Super Administrator" in purple
- All admin functions should be accessible

If Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify user role is correctly set in database (already confirmed)
3. Check Auth0 token contains correct role information
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode
