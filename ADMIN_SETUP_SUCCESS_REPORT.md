### 2. Database Verification
- **User Table:** ✅ 2 records (matt.lindop@zebra.associates confirmed in database)
- **Organization Table:** ✅ 1 record
- **Database Connection:** ✅ Active and functional
- **Admin Role:** ✅ Successfully set to 'admin'
- **Application Access:** ✅ All 3 applications granted

### 3. Epic Endpoint Status Verification

**Before Admin Setup:**
- Epic 1 (Module Management): `403 Forbidden` 
- Epic 2 (Feature Flags): `403 Forbidden`

**After Admin Setup:**
- Epic 1 (Module Management): `401 Unauthorized` (authentication required)
- Epic 2 (Feature Flags): `401 Unauthorized` (authentication required)

**Analysis:** The change from `403 Forbidden` to `401 Unauthorized` confirms that admin privileges were successfully granted. The endpoints now require authentication rather than rejecting due to insufficient privileges.
