# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Root Cause Found
The `platform-wrapper/backend/` directory containing all Phase 1 Lazy Initialization code is **NOT tracked in Git** and therefore **NOT available to Render for deployment**.

## Issue Summary
- **Problem**: Render cannot find `/opt/render/project/src/platform-wrapper/backend`
- **Cause**: The entire `platform-wrapper/` directory is not in the GitHub repository
- **Impact**: £925K Odeon opportunity BLOCKED - no backend code available for deployment

## Directory Structure Issue
```
Local filesystem (exists):
/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/
├── render.yaml (tracked in git)
└── platform-wrapper/
    └── backend/          ← NOT IN GIT REPOSITORY
        ├── Dockerfile    ← Render cannot access this
        ├── app/          ← All Phase 1 code unavailable
        └── ...

GitHub repository (missing):
- render.yaml references `platform-wrapper/backend/Dockerfile`
- But `platform-wrapper/` directory doesn't exist in repository
```

## Why This Happened
1. The `platform-wrapper/` directory contains embedded git repositories (submodules)
2. These were never properly added to the main repository
3. All Phase 1 implementation exists only locally, not in GitHub
4. Render is trying to build from GitHub where the code doesn't exist

## Immediate Action Required
1. The `platform-wrapper/backend/` directory must be added to the repository
2. Handle the embedded git repository warning
3. Push the actual backend code to GitHub
4. Only then can Render access and deploy the Phase 1 implementation

## Business Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **£925K Opportunity**: Currently impossible to deploy
- **Technical Debt**: Months of development not properly version controlled
- **Risk**: Local-only code could be lost

## Resolution Steps
1. Remove `.git` directories from embedded repositories if they exist
2. Properly add `platform-wrapper/` to the main repository
3. Commit and push all backend code
4. Verify files appear in GitHub repository
5. Trigger Render deployment

This explains why all deployment attempts have failed - Render literally cannot access the code it needs to build.
