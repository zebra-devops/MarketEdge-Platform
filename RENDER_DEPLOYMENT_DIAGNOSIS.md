# Render Deployment Failure Diagnosis Report

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Issue:** Staging service and database not created on Render despite render.yaml configuration

## Executive Summary

The Render platform has not created the expected staging services (`marketedge-platform-staging` and `marketedge-staging-db`) despite the render.yaml file being properly configured and validated. The issue appears to be that Render's Blueprint sync is not automatically creating new services defined in the YAML file.

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Production Service**: `marketedge-platform` is running and healthy
2. **render.yaml Validation**: File passes all syntax and configuration checks
3. **GitHub Workflows**: Staging deployment workflow is running but waiting for non-existent service
4. **Branch Configuration**: Staging branch exists with proper render.yaml

### ❌ What's Not Working
1. **Staging Service**: `marketedge-platform-staging` does not exist (404 with `x-render-routing: no-server`)
2. **Staging Database**: `marketedge-staging-db` not provisioned
3. **Blueprint Sync**: render.yaml changes not creating new services

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Blueprint Sync Limitations

Render's Blueprint (render.yaml) has important limitations:
1. **Existing Services Only**: Blueprint sync primarily updates existing services, it doesn't automatically create new ones
2. **Manual Blueprint Connection Required**: New services defined in render.yaml require manual creation or explicit Blueprint connection
3. **Service Discovery**: Render may not detect new service definitions without manual intervention

### Evidence
- `curl https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com/health` returns 404 with `x-render-routing: no-server`
- GitHub workflow stuck at "Wait for Render Staging Deployment" (11+ minutes)
- Production service working fine, indicating Render account is functional
- render.yaml validates successfully but services aren't created

## Detailed Findings

### 1. render.yaml Configuration (✅ Valid)
```yaml
services:
  - name: marketedge-platform-staging
    branch: staging
    runtime: python
    plan: free

databases:
  - name: marketedge-staging-db
    databaseName: marketedge_staging
    plan: free
```

### 2. GitHub Workflow Status
- **Run ID**: 18199414475
- **Status**: In progress (stuck waiting for Render deployment)
- **Job**: "Wait for Render Staging Deployment" - attempting to reach non-existent service

### 3. Service Endpoint Tests
```bash
# Production (Working)
https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/health
Status: 200 OK
Response: {"status": "healthy", "mode": "STABLE_PRODUCTION_FULL_API"}

# Staging (Not Found)
https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com/health
Status: 404 Not Found
Header: x-render-routing: no-server
```

## Required Actions to Fix

### Option 1: Manual Service Creation (Recommended - Immediate Fix)

1. **Log into Render Dashboard**
   - Navigate to https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Create Staging Web Service Manually**
   ```
   Name: marketedge-platform-staging
   Repository: Connect to GitHub repo
   Branch: staging
   Runtime: Python 3
   Build Command: python --version && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt
   Start Command: ./render-startup.sh
   Plan: Free
   ```

3. **Create Staging Database**
   ```
   Name: marketedge-staging-db
   Database: marketedge_staging
   Plan: Free
   ```

4. **Connect to Blueprint**
   - After creation, go to service settings
   - Enable "Infrastructure as Code"
   - Connect to render.yaml in repository
   - This links the service to the Blueprint for future updates

5. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Set all required environment variables from render.yaml
   - Ensure `fromGroup: staging-env` variables are configured
   - Add secrets that require manual configuration

### Option 2: Blueprint Re-initialization

1. **Delete render.yaml temporarily**
   ```bash
   git rm render.yaml
   git commit -m "temp: remove render.yaml for re-initialization"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Use Render Dashboard to create Blueprint**
   - Click "New" → "Blueprint"
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Select main branch
   - Let Render discover render.yaml

3. **Restore render.yaml**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Render CLI Deployment (If Available)

```bash
# Install Render CLI
brew tap render-oss/render
brew install render

# Deploy services
render blueprint deploy --file render.yaml
```

## Environment Variables to Configure

After service creation, configure these in Render Dashboard:

### Staging Service Environment Variables
```
# From staging-env group
DATABASE_URL: [from marketedge-staging-db]
REDIS_URL: [shared or new Redis instance]
AUTH0_DOMAIN: zebra-app.eu.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET: [from Auth0 dashboard]
AUTH0_ACTION_SECRET: [from Auth0 dashboard]
JWT_SECRET_KEY: [unique for staging]
CORS_ORIGINS: https://staging.zebra.associates,https://*.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
ENVIRONMENT: staging
RUN_MIGRATIONS: true
```

## Verification Steps

After fixing:

1. **Verify Service Creation**
   ```bash
   curl https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com/health
   # Should return 200 with health status
   ```

2. **Check Database Connection**
   ```bash
   # In Render logs, verify:
   # "Database migrations completed successfully"
   ```

3. **Validate Auth0 Integration**
   ```bash
   curl https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/auth0-url?redirect_uri=https://staging.zebra.associates/callback
   # Should return Auth0 authorization URL
   ```

4. **Re-run GitHub Workflow**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run staging-deploy.yml --ref staging
   ```

## Prevention for Future

1. **Document Render Blueprint Limitations**
   - Blueprint sync updates existing services but doesn't create new ones
   - New services require manual creation or explicit Blueprint deployment

2. **Update Deployment Documentation**
   - Add section on manual service creation
   - Document Blueprint connection process

3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
   - Use Render API for programmatic service creation
   - Implement Terraform for infrastructure management
   - Use Render CLI in CI/CD pipeline

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Access Render Dashboard** and manually create the staging services
2. **Configure environment variables** as specified above
3. **Connect services to Blueprint** for future updates
4. **Verify deployment** using the verification steps
5. **Re-run staging workflow** to complete smoke tests

## Conclusion

The issue is not with the render.yaml configuration or validation, but with Render's Blueprint sync mechanism not automatically creating new services. Manual intervention through the Render Dashboard is required to create the initial services, after which they can be connected to the Blueprint for ongoing management.
