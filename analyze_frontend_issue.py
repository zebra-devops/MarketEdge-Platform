Analyze the frontend data disconnect issue for matt.lindop@zebra.associates

Based on the debug script, we know the backend APIs are returning correct data:
- Role: super_admin
- Applications: all 3 granted

But the user management UI shows:
- Role: viewer
- Applications: none granted

This suggests a frontend issue with data processing, caching, or rendering.
