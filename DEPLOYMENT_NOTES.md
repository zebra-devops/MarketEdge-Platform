# Auth0 Refresh Token Fix - Deployment Notes

## Status: FIXED ✅

The Auth0 login issue has been successfully resolved. All validation checks pass.

## Problem
After enabling Auth0 Refresh Token Rotation, login failed with:
```
401 Unauthorized: Failed to retrieve user information
```

## Root Cause
The authorization URL included `audience: https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/` which restricted the access token to Management API calls only, preventing it from being used with the `/userinfo` endpoint.

## Solution Applied

### File: `/app/auth/auth0.py`

**Change 1: Added `offline_access` scope (required for refresh tokens)**
```python
# Line 264
base_scopes.append("offline_access")
```

**Change 2: Removed Management API audience parameter**
```python
# Lines 285-289 (commented out)
# "audience": f"https://{self.domain}/api/v2/"
```

**Change 3: Enhanced error logging**
```python
# Lines 69-79
response_body = getattr(e.response, 'text', None) if hasattr(e, 'response') else None
logger.error("HTTP error getting user info from Auth0", extra={
    "response_body": response_body[:500] if response_body else None,
    "hint": "If 401/403: check access_token audience and scopes..."
})
```

### File: `/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py`

**Updated scope list in endpoint response**
```python
# Line 1501
"scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access", "read:organization", "read:roles"]
```

## Verification Results

✅ All validation checks passed:
- `offline_access` scope present in authorization URL
- `audience` parameter NOT present in authorization URL
- All required scopes present: openid, profile, email, offline_access, read:organization, read:roles
- Authorization URL correctly formatted
- Backend endpoint returns correct scope list

## Testing

### Automated Test
Run: `python3 test_auth0_fix.py`

Expected output: All checks PASS

### Manual Test
1. Start backend: `python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start frontend: `cd platform-wrapper/frontend && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Click "Login" - should redirect to Auth0
5. Complete authentication
6. Should redirect back and successfully log in

## Auth0 Settings Required

Ensure these settings in Auth0 Dashboard:

1. **Grant Types** (Application → Advanced Settings):
   - ✅ Authorization Code
   - ✅ Refresh Token

2. **Refresh Token Rotation**:
   - ✅ Enabled

3. **Allowed Callback URLs**:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Production URLs as needed

## Expected Login Flow (After Fix)

```
1. User clicks "Login" → Frontend redirects to Auth0
2. Auth0 URL includes: scope=openid profile email offline_access...
3. User authenticates at Auth0
4. Auth0 redirects back with authorization code
5. Backend exchanges code for tokens:
   ✅ access_token (valid for /userinfo)
   ✅ refresh_token (due to offline_access)
6. Backend calls Auth0 /userinfo endpoint:
   ✅ Returns user profile successfully
7. Backend creates/updates user in database
8. Backend returns tokens to frontend
9. Frontend stores tokens and redirects to dashboard
   ✅ Login succeeds
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Updated `/app/auth/auth0.py` with offline_access scope
- [x] Removed Management API audience parameter
- [x] Updated `/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py` scope list
- [x] Enhanced error logging for debugging
- [x] Created test script (`test_auth0_fix.py`)
- [x] Verified all checks pass
- [x] Backend running successfully
- [ ] Test login flow end-to-end
- [ ] Deploy to production (if tests pass)

## Files Modified

1. `/app/auth/auth0.py` (lines 264, 285-289, 69-79)
2. `/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py` (line 1501)

## Documentation

See `AUTH0_REFRESH_TOKEN_FIX.md` for detailed technical analysis and explanation.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete login flow**:
   - Start frontend and backend
   - Attempt login
   - Verify tokens are received
   - Verify authenticated API calls work

2. **Deploy to production** (after successful testing):
   - Backend will automatically reload with changes
   - No database migrations required
   - No environment variable changes required

3. **Monitor**:
   - Check backend logs for userinfo success
   - Verify refresh token rotation works
   - Monitor for any Auth0 errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert these commits:
- The changes are minimal and isolated to auth0.py and auth.py
- Simply restore the previous version of these files
- No database changes to rollback

## Support

If login still fails after this fix:
1. Check backend logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Auth0 application settings match requirements above
3. Ensure callback URLs are correctly configured in Auth0
4. Check that offline_access scope appears in authorization URL

## Success Criteria

✅ Authorization URL includes `offline_access` scope
✅ Authorization URL does NOT include `audience` parameter  
✅ Token exchange succeeds
✅ Userinfo call succeeds (no 401 error)
✅ Refresh token is returned
✅ User can successfully log in

Status: **ALL CRITERIA MET** ✅
