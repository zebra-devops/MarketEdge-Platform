Fix: ApplicationType enum case mismatch resolved

This file triggers a deployment to restart the backend with the corrected enum values.

Critical Fix Applied:
- Python enum values updated from lowercase to UPPERCASE to match database
- MARKET_EDGE = "MARKET_EDGE" 
- CAUSAL_EDGE = "CAUSAL_EDGE"
- VALUE_EDGE = "VALUE_EDGE"

Expected Result:
- Admin verification endpoint will stop returning 500 errors
- matt.lindop@zebra.associates will have working admin access
- £925K opportunity will be unblocked

DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED: Backend needs restart to load corrected Python enum definitions
