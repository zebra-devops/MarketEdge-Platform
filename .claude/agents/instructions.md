## Best Practices for Agent Instructions

### ‚úÖ **Effective Instruction Patterns:**

#### **Be Specific About Scope:**
```bash
‚úÖ "Use dev to implement JWT authentication integration with Auth0 following ta's security specifications"
‚ùå "Use dev to work on authentication"
```

#### **Include Context and Constraints:**
```bash
‚úÖ "Use po to create user stories for tenant isolation features targeting 95% test coverage"
‚ùå "Use po to create some stories"
```

#### **Specify Expected Outcomes:**
```bash
‚úÖ "Use cr to review pricing API implementation focusing on performance and multi-tenant security"
‚ùå "Use cr to review the code"
```

#### **Reference Previous Work:**
```bash
‚úÖ "Use devops to configure production deployment incorporating ta's architecture recommendations from Issue #2"
‚ùå "Use devops to deploy to production"
```

### ‚ùå **Avoid These Instruction Patterns:**

#### **Vague or Ambiguous:**
```bash
‚ùå "Use qa-orch to handle the project"
‚ùå "Use ta to look at the architecture"
‚ùå "Use po to do product stuff"
```

#### **Multiple Conflicting Goals:**
```bash
‚ùå "Use dev to implement authentication and also fix the database and deploy to production"
```

#### **Assuming Context Not Provided:**
```bash
‚ùå "Use cr to review the latest changes" (without specifying what changes)
```
