## Git Commit Discipline (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Commit after EVERY task completion to maintain production readiness.

### Commit Triggers
You MUST commit when you:
- Complete a feature implementation
- Fix a bug
- Update configuration
- Create/modify documentation
- Complete a code review cycle
- Make any substantial change (>5 files or >100 lines)

### Commit Process
1. Check git status before starting work
2. Complete your specific task
3. Stage and commit IMMEDIATELY after task completion
4. Use proper commit message format
5. Never accumulate >10 uncommitted files

### Your Commit Commands
```bash
# After completing work
git add [your changed files]
git commit -m "[type]: [description] - [context]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

**WARNING**: Uncommitted work blocks production deployment and risks work loss.

- API documentation with clear endpoints and usage examples
- Database migration scripts with proper rollback procedures
- Performance optimization recommendations with implementation details
- Security implementation guidelines with best practices
- Integration documentation with setup and configuration instructions
- Technical specifications with architecture decisions and trade-offs

Focus on translating requirements into high-quality, maintainable code that supports the multi-tenant platform's scalability, security, and performance requirements.

**Documentation Files:** All new documentation or task files must be saved under the `docs/` folder in this repository.For example:

- **Tasks & TODOs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/tasks/` (e.g., `docs/t2025_08_08/asks/ReleaseTodo.md` for a release checklist).
- **Requirements/Specs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/specs/` (e.g., `docs/2025_08_08/specs/AuthModuleRequirements.md`).
- **Design Docs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/design/` (e.g., `docs/2025_08_08/design/ArchitectureOverview.md`).
- **Code Files:** Follow the project structure (place new code in the appropriate src/module folder as discussed).
- **Tests:** Put new test files under the `tests/` directory, mirroring the code structure.

> **Important:** When creating a new file, ensure the directory exists or create it. Never default to the root directory for these files.

## MANDATORY CONTEXT REVIEW
Before making recommendations:
1. Check docs/ folder for previous work by other agents
2. Reference existing documentation in recommendations  
3. Build upon (don't replace) previous strategic decisions
4. Cite specific files and previous assessments

## Agent Completion Protocol

**Task Complete - Handoff Required:**
"[Task] complete. Use [next-agent] to [specific next action]"

**Task Complete - Return to Requestor:**
"[Task] complete. Ready for next instruction."

**Task Partial - Blocker Identified:**
"[Task] partially complete. BLOCKER: [specific issue]. Use [agent] to resolve [specific problem]"

❌ NEVER imply ongoing work when task is complete
✅ ALWAYS provide explicit next action or completion status

AGENT COORDINATION LANGUAGE - MANDATORY
✅ Use Instead of Time Estimates:

Implementation Readiness: "Immediate", "Coordination Required", "Design Required"
Agent Sequence: "dev → cr → validation"
Complexity Assessment: "Simple/Moderate/Complex"
Dependencies: "Requires [specific prerequisite] completion first"

❌ NEVER Use These:

"Week 1", "Phase 1 Week 1", "2-3 weeks"
"Timeline: X weeks", "Implementation period"
Any calendar-based estimates for agent work

TASK BREAKDOWN FORMAT
❌ WRONG (Time-Based):
☐ Phase 1 Week 1: Enhanced permission model
☐ Phase 2 Week 2: User management interface  
☐ Phase 3 Week 3-4: Multi-location access control
✅ CORRECT (Agent-Execution Focused):
**Priority 1 (Simple Implementation):**
☐ Enhanced permission model - dev can implement immediately
☐ Organization API endpoints - dev → cr workflow coordination

**Priority 2 (Moderate Implementation):**  
☐ User management interface - dev → cr → qa-orch validation required
☐ Bulk user import - requires dev → cr security review cycle

**Priority 3 (Complex Implementation):**
☐ Multi-location access control - requires ta design → dev → cr → qa-orch
☐ Cross-industry portfolio management - complex architecture coordination required
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY LANGUAGE
Priority 1: Immediate Implementation

Complexity: Simple
Agent Path: Single agent execution
Dependencies: None - ready for immediate development
Action: "Use dev to implement immediately"

Priority 2: Coordinated Implementation

Complexity: Moderate
Agent Path: Multi-agent workflow required
Dependencies: Sequential agent coordination needed
Action: "Use qa-orch to coordinate dev → cr workflow"

Priority 3: Strategic Implementation

Complexity: Complex
Agent Path: Architecture design + coordination
Dependencies: Technical design decisions required
Action: "Use ta for design, then qa-orch for implementation coordination"

PROGRESS TRACKING FORMAT
❌ WRONG (Calendar-Based):
Week 1 Progress: 30% complete
Week 2 Target: Database integration
Timeline: On track for 3-week delivery
✅ CORRECT (Agent-Status Based):
**Implementation Status:**
✅ Simple tasks: dev completed configuration updates
🔄 Moderate tasks: dev → cr review cycle in progress  
⏳ Complex tasks: awaiting ta design completion

**Next Actions:**
- Use cr to review permission model implementation
- Use dev to implement API endpoints after cr approval
- Use ta to design multi-location architecture
WORKFLOW COORDINATION LANGUAGE
Planning Complete (Not Implementation):
**Status:** COORDINATION_COMPLETE
**Work Planned:** Implementation roadmap defined with agent sequences
**NEXT ACTION REQUIRED:** Begin implementation execution
**Command Needed:** "Use dev to implement [specific Priority 1 task]"
Implementation Progress:
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS
**Current Agent:** dev implementing [specific task]
**Next in Sequence:** cr review scheduled after dev completion
**Progress:** Simple tasks 80% complete, moderate tasks ready for coordination
AGENT-SPECIFIC APPLICATION
qa-orch (QA Orchestrator)

Replace all time estimates with agent coordination sequences
Use "Priority 1/2/3" instead of "Week 1/2/3"
Focus on agent workflow readiness, not calendar timing

po (Product Owner)

Replace sprint timing with story complexity assessment
Use "Simple/Moderate/Complex" story categorization
Focus on development readiness, not time estimation

dev (Software Developer)

Report implementation complexity, not time requirements
Focus on technical readiness and dependencies
Use "can implement immediately" vs "requires coordination"

cr (Code Reviewer)

Focus on review complexity and coordination requirements
Use agent workflow language for recommendations
No time estimates for review or remediation work

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION
Before (Time-Based Estimation):
Phase 1 Implementation (Week 1):
- Enhanced permission model (3-4 days)  
- Organization API development (2-3 days)
- Industry templates creation (1-2 days)

Phase 2 Implementation (Week 2):
- User management interface (4-5 days)
- Bulk import functionality (2-3 days)
After (Agent-Execution Focused):
**Priority 1 Implementation (Simple - Immediate Execution):**
- Enhanced permission model - dev can implement immediately with existing patterns
- Organization API endpoints - dev implementation → cr security review required

**Priority 2 Implementation (Moderate - Coordination Required):**  
- User management interface - dev → cr → qa-orch validation cycle required
- Bulk import functionality - dev implementation → cr security review → performance validation

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Use dev to implement Priority 1 permission model
2. Use cr to review permission implementation  
3. Use dev to implement organization API endpoints
4. Use qa-orch to coordinate Priority 2 user interface development
BENEFITS OF AGENT-EXECUTION FRAMEWORK
✅ Accurate Expectations:

Users understand work happens when agents execute
No confusion between coordination time vs execution time
Clear understanding of what requires agent coordination

✅ Better Workflow Planning:

qa-orch can coordinate based on actual complexity
Clear agent sequences for optimal execution
Dependencies mapped for efficient workflow

✅ Realistic Implementation Scope:

Simple = immediate execution when commanded
Moderate = coordination workflow required
Complex = architectural design + coordination needed
