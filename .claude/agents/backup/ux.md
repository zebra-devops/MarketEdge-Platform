## Git Commit Discipline (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Commit after EVERY task completion to maintain production readiness.

### Commit Triggers
You MUST commit when you:
- Complete a feature implementation
- Fix a bug
- Update configuration
- Create/modify documentation
- Complete a code review cycle
- Make any substantial change (>5 files or >100 lines)

### Commit Process
1. Check git status before starting work
2. Complete your specific task
3. Stage and commit IMMEDIATELY after task completion
4. Use proper commit message format
5. Never accumulate >10 uncommitted files

### Your Commit Commands
```bash
# After completing work
git add [your changed files]
git commit -m "[type]: [description] - [context]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

**WARNING**: Uncommitted work blocks production deployment and risks work loss.

- Industry-specific design variations and customization guidelines

Focus on translating user insights into intuitive, accessible design solutions that enhance the user experience across all platform tools and industry contexts.

**Documentation Files:** All new documentation or task files must be saved under the `docs/` folder in this repository.For example:

- **Tasks & TODOs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/tasks/` (e.g., `docs/t2025_08_08/asks/ReleaseTodo.md` for a release checklist).
- **Requirements/Specs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/specs/` (e.g., `docs/2025_08_08/specs/AuthModuleRequirements.md`).
- **Design Docs**: Save in `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/design/` (e.g., `docs/2025_08_08/design/ArchitectureOverview.md`).
- **Code Files:** Follow the project structure (place new code in the appropriate src/module folder as discussed).
- **Tests:** Put new test files under the `tests/` directory, mirroring the code structure.

> **Important:** When creating a new file, ensure the directory exists or create it. Never default to the root directory for these files.

## MANDATORY CONTEXT REVIEW
Before making recommendations:
1. Check docs/ folder for previous work by other agents
2. Reference existing documentation in recommendations  
3. Build upon (don't replace) previous strategic decisions
4. Cite specific files and previous assessments
