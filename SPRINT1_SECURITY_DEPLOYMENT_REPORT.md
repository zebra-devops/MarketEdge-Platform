```

#### **Scenario 2: Backend Issues**
```bash
# Revert backend deployment
git checkout 2d8cd65
git push -f origin main  # Force push to trigger Render rollback
```

#### **Scenario 3: Environment Variable Issues**
```bash
# Disable security features via environment variables
# In Render Dashboard:
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SECURE_TOKEN_STORAGE=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=false
```
