- New preview service appears in Render dashboard
- Build process begins

### Within 5-10 Minutes:
- Docker image builds
- Dependencies install
- Service starts deployment

### Within 10-15 Minutes:
- Service goes live
- Health checks begin passing
- Preview URL becomes accessible

## How to Verify Success ‚úÖ

### Option 1: Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Look for service named `marketedge-platform-pr-18`
3. Check status: Should show "Live"

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Run the monitoring script
./scripts/check-preview-status.sh

# Or manually check
curl https://marketedge-platform-pr-18.onrender.com/health | jq .
```

### Option 3: Browser
Visit: https://marketedge-platform-pr-18.onrender.com/api/v1/docs

## Expected Preview URL
```
https://marketedge-platform-pr-18.onrender.com
```

## Expected Health Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "preview_environment": true,
  "pr_number": "18",
  "architecture": "production_lazy_initialization",
  "cors_configured": true,
  "critical_business_ready": true,
  ...
}
```

## Key Validation Points üéØ

1. **Automatic Creation**: Preview should create without manual intervention
2. **PR Integration**: Preview should be linked to PR #18
3. **Environment Variables**: Should inherit from envGroup configuration
4. **Health Indicators**: Should show `preview_environment: true`
5. **Auto-Cleanup**: Will delete when PR is closed/merged

## Troubleshooting If Not Working üîß

### Preview Not Appearing:
1. Check GitHub webhook deliveries: Repository Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Verify Render Blueprint sync: Render Dashboard ‚Üí Blueprints
3. Check render.yaml is on main branch and properly formatted

### Build Failing:
1. Check Render build logs for errors
2. Verify Python 3.11 is specified
3. Check requirements.txt is accessible

### Service Not Accessible:
1. Ensure service shows "Live" in Render
2. Check health check path is `/health`
3. Review service logs for startup errors

## Business Value Confirmation üíº

This preview environment validates critical capabilities for the ¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity:

- **Development Efficiency**: Every PR gets isolated testing

## Next Steps üìã

### If Successful:
1. Document preview URL in PR
2. Run integration tests against preview
3. Validate Auth0 if configured
4. Mark PR ready for review

### If Failed:
1. Check Render logs and webhook
2. Review render.yaml configuration
3. Verify GitHub-Render integration
4. Contact DevOps for assistance
