## STORY 1: API Gateway & Rate Limiting Implementation

### User Story
**As a** platform operator managing multi-tenant cinema, hotel, and retail clients  
**I want** a comprehensive API gateway with intelligent rate limiting and request routing  
**So that** I can ensure fair resource allocation, prevent abuse, prevent system overload, and provide SLA guarantees to enterprise clients across different industries

### Business Value
- **Revenue Impact**: Enables cinema industry expansion with high-volume data processing capabilities
- **Market Expansion**: Unlocks enterprise clients requiring SLA guarantees  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents system overload and ensures platform stability
- **Competitive Advantage**: Enables differentiated service tiers for premium clients

### Priority & Estimation
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical Blocker
- **Story Points**: 13 (Large/Complex)
- **Estimated Duration**: 5-7 days
- **Dependencies**: Security foundation (completed), tenant context middleware (completed)

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Rate Limiting Implementation
- **GIVEN** a multi-tenant platform with different industry clients
- **WHEN** API requests are made by different tenants and user types
- **THEN** the system should apply appropriate rate limits:
  - Super Admin (Zebra): 1000 requests/minute
  - Client Admin: 500 requests/minute  
  - End User: 200 requests/minute
  - Cinema clients: 800 requests/minute (high-volume data processing)
  - Hotel clients: 400 requests/minute
  - Retail clients: 300 requests/minute
- **AND** rate limits should be configurable per tenant via feature flags
- **AND** rate limit violations should return HTTP 429 with retry-after header

#### AC2: Request Routing & Load Balancing
- **GIVEN** multiple backend service instances
- **WHEN** requests are received through the API gateway
- **THEN** requests should be intelligently routed based on:
  - Tenant context and SIC code
  - Request type and resource requirements
  - Service health and response times
- **AND** requests should be load balanced across healthy instances
- **AND** failed requests should be retried with exponential backoff

#### AC3: Authentication & Authorization Integration
- **GIVEN** the existing Auth0 JWT authentication system
- **WHEN** requests pass through the API gateway
- **THEN** authentication should be validated at the gateway level
- **AND** tenant context should be extracted and passed to backend services
- **AND** unauthorized requests should be rejected with HTTP 401/403
- **AND** authentication should work seamlessly with existing RLS security

#### AC4: Monitoring & Metrics Collection
- **GIVEN** API gateway processing requests
- **WHEN** requests are processed
- **THEN** the following metrics should be collected:
  - Request count per tenant, endpoint, and time period
  - Response times (p50, p95, p99)
  - Error rates and status codes
  - Rate limit violations and rejections
  - Throughput and bandwidth usage
- **AND** metrics should be exportable to Prometheus format
- **AND** metrics should support alerting thresholds

#### AC5: Multi-Tenant Configuration Management
- **GIVEN** different industry clients with varying requirements
- **WHEN** configuring rate limits and routing rules
