### Minor Recommendations

1. **Database Integration Enhancement**
   ```recommendation
   Priority: Medium
   
   Current tenant authorization validation uses TODO placeholders.
   Recommend implementing actual database queries to validate:
   - User-tenant relationships
   - Admin role verification
   - Tenant subscription levels
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Configuration UI**
   ```recommendation
   Priority: Low
   
   Current configuration is code-based.
   Consider admin interface for runtime rate limit adjustments
   per tenant without code deployments.
   ```

3. **Advanced Monitoring**
   ```recommendation
   Priority: Low
   
   Current monitoring covers basics.
   Consider adding predictive alerts for approaching limits
   and capacity planning metrics.
   ```
