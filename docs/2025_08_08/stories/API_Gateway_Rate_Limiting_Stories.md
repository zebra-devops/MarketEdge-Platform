# API Gateway & Rate Limiting User Stories

## Epic: API Gateway & Rate Limiting Implementation
**Priority:** Critical for Production
**Business Value:** Essential for platform stability, security, and scalability in multi-tenant environment

---

## Story 1: Implement API Gateway Infrastructure

### User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want** an API gateway to centrally manage all API requests  
**So that** I can ensure consistent routing, authentication, and monitoring across all platform services

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API Gateway deployed and configured to handle all incoming API requests
- [ ] All existing API endpoints routed through the gateway without breaking functionality
- [ ] Gateway supports tenant-aware routing based on request headers or tokens
- [ ] Health check endpoints available for monitoring gateway status
- [ ] Gateway logs all requests with tenant context for audit purposes
- [ ] SSL/TLS termination handled at gateway level
- [ ] Request/response transformation capabilities configured
- [ ] Gateway configuration stored in version control

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Support for FastAPI backend services
- [ ] Integration with Auth0 authentication flow
- [ ] Compatible with existing tenant context middleware
- [ ] Supports both REST API and potential WebSocket connections
- [ ] Configurable timeout and retry policies per service

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All API traffic routed through gateway without service interruption
- [ ] Performance tests show no degradation compared to direct API access
- [ ] All existing tests pass with gateway in place
- [ ] Documentation updated with gateway architecture and configuration
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show gateway metrics and health status

## Story 2: Implement Rate Limiting per Tenant

### User Story
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** rate limiting applied per tenant organization  
**So that** no single tenant can overwhelm the platform resources and affect other tenants' performance

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented with tenant-specific quotas
- [ ] Different rate limits configurable per tenant tier/plan
- [ ] Rate limits enforced at API gateway level
- [ ] Clear error responses (429 Too Many Requests) when limits exceeded
- [ ] Rate limit headers included in all API responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- [ ] Rate limit configuration stored per organization in database
- [ ] Admin interface to view and modify tenant rate limits
- [ ] Metrics tracking rate limit violations per tenant

### Business Rules
- [ ] Default rate limits: 1000 requests/hour for standard tenants
- [ ] Premium tenants: 5000 requests/hour
- [ ] Enterprise tenants: 10000 requests/hour
- [ ] Super admin operations exempt from rate limiting
- [ ] Health check endpoints exempt from rate limiting
- [ ] Rate limits reset on hourly basis

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Redis-based rate limiting for distributed scalability
- [ ] Sliding window algorithm for smooth rate limiting
- [ ] Tenant identification from JWT token claims
- [ ] Fallback rate limiting if tenant cannot be identified
- [ ] Rate limit bypass for emergency admin operations

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Rate limiting active and enforced across all API endpoints
- [ ] Load testing confirms rate limits are respected
- [ ] Admin can modify tenant rate limits through UI
- [ ] Monitoring shows rate limit metrics per tenant
- [ ] Documentation includes rate limiting policies and admin procedures

## Story 3: Implement API Request/Response Monitoring

### User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of API requests and responses  
**So that** I can identify performance issues, security threats, and usage patterns across tenants

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API requests logged with tenant context, endpoint, method, status code, response time
- [ ] Request/response payload logging for debugging (with PII redaction)
- [ ] Real-time metrics available for API performance monitoring
- [ ] Alerting configured for API error rates, slow responses, and unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Dashboard showing API usage patterns per tenant and endpoint
- [ ] Integration with existing logging infrastructure
- [ ] Structured logging format for easy parsing and analysis
- [ ] Correlation IDs tracked across service boundaries

### Monitoring Metrics
- [ ] Request rate per tenant and endpoint
- [ ] Response time percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99)
- [ ] Error rate by status code and tenant
- [ ] Rate limit violations per tenant
- [ ] Gateway availability and health status
- [ ] Payload size distribution
- [ ] Authentication failure rates

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integration with platform logging service
- [ ] Metrics exportable to monitoring dashboard
- [ ] PII data automatically redacted from logs
- [ ] Configurable log retention policies
- [ ] Support for log aggregation and search

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive API monitoring active across all endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible to platform operators
- [ ] Alerting rules configured and tested
- [ ] Log data available for troubleshooting and analysis
- [ ] Performance impact of monitoring is minimal (<5ms overhead)

## Story 4: Implement API Gateway Security Features

### User Story
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** advanced security features at the API gateway level  
**So that** I can protect the platform from attacks and ensure data security across all tenants

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Request validation and sanitization at gateway level
- [ ] SQL injection and XSS attack prevention
- [ ] IP-based blocking and allowlisting capabilities
- [ ] Request size limits enforced
- [ ] Suspicious activity detection and blocking
- [ ] CORS policy enforcement
- [ ] Security headers added to all responses
- [ ] Integration with Auth0 for token validation

### Security Features
- [ ] Request body size limits (configurable per endpoint)
- [ ] Malicious payload detection and blocking
- [ ] Brute force attack protection
- [ ] Geographic IP filtering if required
- [ ] API key validation for external integrations
- [ ] Audit logging for all security events

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] WAF-like capabilities integrated into gateway
- [ ] Real-time security threat detection
- [ ] Security rule configuration through admin interface
- [ ] Integration with existing security monitoring tools
- [ ] Emergency blocking capabilities for immediate threat response

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Security features active and protecting all API endpoints
- [ ] Security testing confirms protection against common attacks
- [ ] Security incidents logged and alerting configured
- [ ] Admin interface available for security rule management
- [ ] Security documentation updated with new capabilities

## Dependencies
1. Redis infrastructure must be available for rate limiting
2. Monitoring and alerting infrastructure must be configured
3. Load balancer configuration may need updates
4. DNS changes may be required for gateway deployment

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Gateway becomes single point of failure
  - **Mitigation:** Deploy gateway in high-availability configuration with health checks
- **Risk:** Performance degradation due to additional network hop
  - **Mitigation:** Thorough performance testing and optimization
- **Risk:** Complex debugging due to additional layer
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring implementation

## Success Metrics
- Zero unplanned API downtime after gateway implementation
- Rate limiting violations tracked and controlled per tenant
- API response times maintained within SLA requirements
- Security incidents detected and blocked at gateway level
- 100% of API requests properly routed and monitored
