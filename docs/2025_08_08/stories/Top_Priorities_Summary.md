### 3. Production Monitoring (Enterprise Requirement)
**Files:** [Production_Monitoring_Stories.md](./Production_Monitoring_Stories.md)  
**Stories:** 5 stories covering APM, infrastructure monitoring, business/security monitoring, incident management, and tenant-aware reporting  
**Business Impact:** Enterprise-grade reliability, security, and operational excellence

**Key Deliverables:**
- Application performance monitoring across all services
- Infrastructure and system health monitoring
- Security event monitoring and incident response
- Tenant-specific health reporting and SLA compliance

## Cross-Epic Dependencies and Integration Points

### API Gateway ↔ Production Monitoring
- API Gateway metrics feed into monitoring dashboards
- Rate limiting violations tracked in business monitoring
- Gateway performance monitored through APM
- Security events correlated between gateway and monitoring systems

### Frontend Testing ↔ Production Monitoring
- E2E test results provide user experience validation
- Frontend performance metrics complement backend APM
- Test execution metrics tracked in monitoring
- Production monitoring validates test coverage assumptions

### API Gateway ↔ Frontend Testing
- Gateway changes require frontend integration testing updates
- Rate limiting behavior validated through E2E testing
- Authentication flows tested end-to-end through gateway
- API mocking in tests must reflect gateway behavior

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team Allocation
- **Backend/DevOps Engineers:** 2-3 engineers for API Gateway and Production Monitoring
- **Frontend Engineers:** 2 engineers for Frontend Testing Framework
- **QA Engineers:** 1 engineer for testing framework validation and E2E test development
- **Product Owner/Technical Lead:** 1 person for coordination and requirement validation

### Infrastructure Requirements

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. API Gateway deployment complexity and potential service disruption
2. Frontend testing framework setup complexity with multi-tenant requirements
3. Monitoring system integration with existing infrastructure

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Phased API Gateway rollout with gradual traffic migration
2. Parallel development and testing environment validation
3. Monitoring system deployed in parallel before production cutover

This comprehensive approach ensures the MarketEdge platform achieves production readiness with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and operational excellence.
