## Dependencies
1. Frontend development environment must be stable
2. Backend API endpoints must be available for integration testing
3. Test environment infrastructure must be configured
4. CI/CD pipeline must support test execution and reporting

## Risks and Mitigations

  - **Mitigation:** Implement parallel test execution and smart test selection
- **Risk:** Flaky tests reduce confidence in test suite
  - **Mitigation:** Robust test setup/teardown and retry mechanisms
- **Risk:** Test maintenance overhead becomes too high
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on testing stable interfaces and critical paths

## Success Metrics
- 80%+ code coverage maintained across all frontend components
- Zero critical user journeys broken in production
- <10 minutes total test execution time in CI/CD
- 95%+ test reliability (non-flaky test rate)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved and maintained
- Frontend deployment confidence increased to support daily releases
