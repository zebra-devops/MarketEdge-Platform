## Story 1: API Gateway & Rate Limiting

### User Story
**As a** Platform Super Admin (Zebra)  
**I want** an API gateway with comprehensive rate limiting capabilities  
**So that** I can protect the multi-tenant platform from abuse, ensure fair resource allocation across tenants, and maintain system stability during traffic spikes  

### Business Value
- **Security**: Prevents API abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Performance**: Ensures equitable resource distribution across tenants
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise-grade SLA requirements
- **Cost Management**: Controls infrastructure costs through traffic management

### Multi-Tenant Considerations
- Tenant-specific rate limits based on subscription tier
- Cross-tenant traffic isolation
- Per-tenant monitoring and alerting
- Feature flag controlled rollout capabilities

### Acceptance Criteria

**When** requests exceed defined rate limits  
**Then** the system should:
- Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with appropriate retry-after headers
- Log rate limit violations with tenant context
- Maintain separate rate limit buckets per tenant
- Support both per-second and per-minute rate limiting windows

#### AC2: Tenant-Specific Configuration
**Given** different tenant subscription tiers exist  
**When** configuring rate limits

- Rate limiting logs should not expose sensitive tenant information
- Testing framework should include security testing capabilities
- Monitoring dashboards require role-based access control

### Performance Impact
- Monitoring overhead should not exceed 2% of system resources
- Rate limiting should add <10ms latency to API requests
- Testing framework should not significantly increase build times
- All implementations should support horizontal scaling

### Integration Requirements
- Rate limiting metrics should feed into monitoring dashboards
- Testing framework should validate monitoring endpoint functionality
- Monitoring should track rate limiting effectiveness
- All systems should use consistent tenant identification

### Rollout Strategy
