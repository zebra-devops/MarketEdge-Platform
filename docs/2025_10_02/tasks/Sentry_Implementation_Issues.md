## Cost Analysis

**Sentry.io Pricing:**
- Free tier: 5,000 errors/month, 10K transactions
- Developer tier: $26/month - 10,000 errors, 50K transactions
- Team tier: $80/month - 50,000 errors, 100K transactions

**Expected Usage:**
- Errors: ~1,000-2,000/month (well within free tier)
- Transactions: 10% sample = ~5,000/month (within free tier)

**ROI:**
- Cost: $0-26/month
- Debugging time saved: ~10-20 hours/month
- Value: $500-1,000/month (developer time)
- **Net ROI: High (20-40x return)**

if settings.SENTRY_DSN:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn=settings.SENTRY_DSN,
        environment=settings.ENVIRONMENT,
        traces_sample_rate=0.1,
        integrations=[
            FastApiIntegration(transaction_style="endpoint"),
            SqlalchemyIntegration(),
        ],
    )
```

### Frontend Configuration
```typescript
// sentry.client.config.ts
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend (Render)
SENTRY_DSN=https://backend-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=secret-token

# Frontend (Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://frontend-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=secret-token
```

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Rules

1. **Critical Error Rate**
   - Condition: 10+ errors in 5 minutes
   - Action: Email + Slack notification
   - Priority: High

2. **New Issues**
   - Condition: New error type in production
   - Action: Email + Slack notification
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Error Spike**
   - Condition: 50% increase in error rate vs. last hour
   - Action: Email + Slack notification
   - Priority: High

### Response Procedures
- Check Sentry dashboard for error details
- Identify affected endpoints/pages
- Assess severity and user impact
- Create incident ticket if needed
- Fix in next release or hotfix if critical
