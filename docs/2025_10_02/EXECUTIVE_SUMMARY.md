**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Branch:** test/trigger-zebra-smoke
**Prepared By:** Maya (DevOps Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Deployment with Prerequisites

---

## Overview

Comprehensive verification of staging/preview environment configurations for MarketEdge Platform reveals **well-structured foundation** with **critical configuration gaps** that must be addressed before deploying authentication fixes.

---

## Configuration Health Score: **7/10** ⚠️

### Strengths ✅
- **Excellent** render.yaml with automatic preview environments
- **Comprehensive** environment variable documentation
- **Proper** separation of production vs staging configuration
- **Good** Vercel project structure and staging setup
- **Robust** deployment verification scripts

### Critical Gaps ❌
1. **AUTH0_AUDIENCE** environment variable not configured (CRITICAL)
2. **CORS_ORIGINS** missing Vercel domains (HIGH priority)
3. **Staging API URL mismatch** between frontend and backend (MEDIUM)
4. **Preview database strategy** needs clarification

---

## Immediate Actions Required (Before Deployment)

### 1. Render Dashboard (15 minutes)

**Navigate:** https://dashboard.render.com → marketedge-platform → Environment

**Add These Variables:**
```bash
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/
AUTH0_AUDIENCE_STAGING=https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/
AUTH0_DOMAIN_STAGING=dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_STAGING=<your-staging-client-id>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET_STAGING=<your-staging-client-secret>
```

**Update This Variable:**
```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=https://platform.marketedge.co.uk,https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com,https://app.zebra.associates,https://staging.zebra.associates,https://*.vercel.app
```

### 2. Auth0 Dashboard (10 minutes)

**Navigate:** https://manage.auth0.com → Applications → [Your App] → Settings

**Add to Allowed Callback URLs:**
```
https://*.vercel.app/callback,https://*.onrender.com/callback
```

**Add to Allowed Logout URLs:**
```
https://*.vercel.app,https://*.onrender.com
```

**Add to Allowed Web Origins:**
```
https://*.vercel.app
```

### 3. Vercel Dashboard (5 minutes)

**Navigate:** https://vercel.com/dashboard → [Your Project] → Settings → Environment Variables

**Set for Preview environment:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<staging-or-production-client-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=preview
```

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Approach: **Pull Request Preview Deployment**

**Why:**
- ✅ Isolated testing environment
- ✅ Zero impact on production
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after 7 days
- ✅ Easy rollback (close PR)
- ✅ Team review before merging

**Total Time:** 70 minutes
- Configuration: 30 minutes
- Deployment: 40 minutes
- Testing: 15 minutes
- Production merge: 5 minutes

**Risk Level:** **LOW** ✅

### Deployment Steps

1. **Complete prerequisite configuration** (above sections)
2. **Create pull request** from `test/trigger-zebra-smoke` to `main`
3. **Monitor preview creation** (Render + Vercel, ~10 minutes)
4. **Run automated verification** script
5. **Perform manual testing** (authentication flow)
6. **Merge to production** if all tests pass

---

## Key Findings

### Configuration Files Analysis

#### render.yaml ✅ EXCELLENT
```yaml
previews:
  generation: automatic      # ✅ Auto-creates preview for PRs
  expireAfterDays: 7        # ✅ Auto-cleanup

# Environment-aware Auth0 configuration
- key: USE_STAGING_AUTH0
  value: "false"
  previewValue: "true"      # ✅ Automatic for previews
```

**Status:** Well-designed with multi-environment Auth0 strategy

#### Vercel Configuration ✅ GOOD

Two configuration files found:
- `vercel-deployment-config.json` (production)
- `vercel-staging.json` (staging)

**Issue:** Staging expects `https://staging-api.zebra.associates` but this backend doesn't exist

**Solutions:**
1. Create DNS CNAME pointing to Render
2. Create dedicated staging Render service
3. Update frontend config to use production backend

### Environment Variable Gaps

| Variable | Production | Preview | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| AUTH0_AUDIENCE | ❌ NOT SET | ❌ NOT SET | **CRITICAL** |
| AUTH0_AUDIENCE_STAGING | N/A | ❌ NOT SET | **CRITICAL** |
| CORS_ORIGINS | ⚠️ INCOMPLETE | ✅ OK | **HIGH** |

**Impact of Missing AUTH0_AUDIENCE:**
- Auth0 returns **opaque tokens** instead of JWT tokens
- Authentication will **fail** after token exchange
- Backend cannot verify token signatures
- **Deployment will fail** without this variable

### CORS Configuration Issue

**Current:**
```
https://platform.marketedge.co.uk,https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com
```

**Required:**
```
https://platform.marketedge.co.uk,https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com,https://app.zebra.associates,https://staging.zebra.associates,https://*.vercel.app
```

**Impact:** Frontend requests will be **blocked by browser CORS policy**

---

## Preview Environment URLs

### Render Backend Preview
**Pattern:** `https://marketedge-platform-pr-<number>.onrender.com`

**Example:** PR #123 → `https://marketedge-platform-pr-123.onrender.com`

**Trigger:** Automatically created when PR is opened

### Vercel Frontend Preview
**Pattern:** `https://<branch-name>-<project>-<org>.vercel.app`

**Example:** `https://test-trigger-zebra-smoke-marketedge-<org>.vercel.app`

**Trigger:** Automatically created on push to branch

---

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these items:

### Automated Checks ✅
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Auth0 URL includes `audience` parameter
- [ ] CORS headers present in responses
- [ ] Token refresh endpoint returns 401 (not 403)
- [ ] Rate limiter status available

### Manual Testing ✅
- [ ] Login flow completes successfully
- [ ] Dashboard loads after authentication
- [ ] Super admin panel accessible
- [ ] Token refresh works without re-login
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Log Verification ✅
- [ ] Rate limiter storage access (no AttributeError)
- [ ] CSRF does not block /api/v1/auth/refresh
- [ ] JWT signature verification via JWKS
- [ ] AUTH0_AUDIENCE in token requests
- [ ] User lookup by email (not UUID)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Preview Deployment Risk: **LOW** ✅

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Production impact | NONE | Isolated preview environment |
| Data corruption | LOW | Separate preview database |
| Cost overrun | LOW | Auto-cleanup after 7 days |
| Configuration errors | MEDIUM | Comprehensive verification script |

### Production Deployment Risk: **MEDIUM** ⚠️

**Acceptable after successful preview testing**

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Authentication failures | MEDIUM | Extensive preview testing |
| Token verification issues | MEDIUM | JWKS verification in preview |
| CORS blocking | LOW | Updated CORS configuration |
| Rollback required | LOW | Quick rollback procedure documented |
