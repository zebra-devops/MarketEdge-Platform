**Title**: `Test: Preview Environment Auth0 Validation`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive Auth0 staging validation endpoints to verify that Render preview environments correctly use staging Auth0 configuration instead of production credentials.

### New Validation Endpoints

- **`/api/v1/system/environment-config`** (Public) - Displays current environment and masked Auth0 configuration
- **`/api/v1/system/staging-health`** (Public) - Comprehensive health check for staging environments
- **`/api/v1/system/auth0-validation`** (Authenticated) - Validates complete Auth0 authentication flow

### Environment Isolation Testing

This PR validates the critical requirement that preview environments:
- ‚úÖ Use staging Auth0 tenant (not production)
- ‚úÖ Have proper CORS configuration for `*.onrender.com` domains
- ‚úÖ Isolate staging data from production
- ‚úÖ Support wildcard URL authentication

### Business Protection

Ensures Matt.Lindop's ¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity is protected by:
- **Complete staging/production isolation**
- **Zero risk of production data exposure in preview environments**
- **Reliable staging workflow for feature development**
- **"Never debug in production again" guarantee**

## Test Plan

### Automated Preview Environment Creation
1. This PR should automatically trigger Render preview environment creation
2. Preview environment URL will be: `https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com`
3. Render should apply staging environment variables automatically

### Validation Steps
1. **Environment Configuration Test**:
   ```bash
   curl https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/api/v1/system/environment-config
   ```
   Expected: `ENVIRONMENT=staging`, `USE_STAGING_AUTH0=true`

2. **Health Check Test**:
   ```bash
   curl https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/api/v1/system/staging-health
   ```
   Expected: `auth0_environment=staging`, database/Redis connectivity

3. **Authentication Test** (with staging Auth0 user):
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <staging-token>" \
        https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/api/v1/system/auth0-validation
   ```
   Expected: Successful authentication using staging Auth0 tenant

### Critical Validation Points
- [ ] Preview environment shows `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
- [ ] Auth0 domain points to staging tenant
- [ ] CORS allows `*.onrender.com` wildcard domains
- [ ] No production credentials exposed
- [ ] Database and Redis connections working
- [ ] Staging test data available

## Documentation

- **Complete validation guide**: `docs/2025_09_21/PreviewEnvironmentValidation.md`
- **Test script**: `test_preview_environment_endpoints.py`
- **Updated startup script**: Enhanced staging environment detection

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: VERY LOW
- Only adds diagnostic endpoints
- No changes to production code paths
- No database schema changes
- All endpoints designed for testing/validation only

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If any issues detected:
1. Close this PR immediately
2. Preview environment will be automatically destroyed
3. No impact on production environment
4. All changes contained to test branch

This PR provides the foundation for reliable preview environment testing and ensures complete staging/production isolation for the Zebra Associates opportunity.

## 3. After Creating Pull Request

Once the PR is created, monitor the following:

### Render Dashboard Monitoring
1. Go to Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Navigate to MarketEdge Backend service
3. Look for "Preview Environments" section
4. Watch for automatic preview environment creation
5. Note the preview URL (will be `https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com`)

### Environment Variable Verification
Ensure Render has the following staging environment variables configured:

**Required Preview Environment Variables**:
```
ENVIRONMENT=staging
USE_STAGING_AUTH0=true
AUTH0_DOMAIN_STAGING=<staging-auth0-domain>
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_STAGING=<staging-client-id>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET_STAGING=<staging-client-secret>
AUTH0_AUDIENCE_STAGING=<staging-audience>
CORS_ORIGINS=https://*.onrender.com,https://localhost:3000
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=true
```

## 4. Testing the Preview Environment

Once the preview environment is deployed:

### Test 1: Public Environment Configuration
```bash
curl https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/api/v1/system/environment-config
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "environment": {
    "ENVIRONMENT": "staging",
    "is_staging": true,
    "USE_STAGING_AUTH0": true
  },
  "auth0_config": {
    "domain": "marketedge-staging.auth0.com"
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Staging Health Check
```bash
curl https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/api/v1/system/staging-health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "HEALTHY",
  "environment": "staging",
  "staging_mode": true,
  "auth0_environment": "staging",
  "database_connected": true,
  "redis_connected": true
}
```

### Test 3: Basic Health Check
```bash
curl https://marketedge-backend-pr-XXX.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "staging"
}
```

## 5. Validation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT` shows "staging"
