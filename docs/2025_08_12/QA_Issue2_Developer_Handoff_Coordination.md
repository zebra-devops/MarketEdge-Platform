### Implementation Guidance Provided
- **Test Failure Resolution** - Achieve >90% test pass rate (currently 55%)
- **Performance Optimization** - Database session management improvements
- **Error Handling Patterns** - Standardized error response architecture
- **Security Framework Integration** - Multi-tenant security pattern implementation

## Software Developer Assignment - IMMEDIATE

### Developer: Software Development Team
**Assignment Priority:** P0-CRITICAL - Immediate Implementation Required  
**Phase:** Implementation of Technical Architect Security Recommendations  
**Timeline:** Implementation completion with quality gates validation

### Technical Specifications for Implementation

#### 1. Critical Security Fixes (P0-CRITICAL)

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries
# Location: app/middleware/industry_context.py

# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE industry = '{industry_input}'"

# AFTER (Secure):
query = "SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE industry = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (industry_input,))
```

**Industry Enum Validation Enhancement:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Replace warnings with enforcement
# Location: app/models/organisation.py

def validate_industry_type(self, value):
    if value not in Industry.__members__:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid industry type: {value}")  # ENFORCE, don't warn
    return value
```

**Tenant Boundary Security:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Add strict tenant validation
# Location: app/middleware/tenant_context.py

def validate_tenant_access(organization_id, current_tenant):
    if not verify_tenant_ownership(organization_id, current_tenant):
        raise TenantIsolationError("Unauthorized cross-tenant access attempt")
```

**JSON Serialization Fix:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Fix Industry enum serialization
# Location: app/api/api_v1/endpoints/organisations.py

class OrganizationResponse(BaseModel):
    industry_type: str  # Serialize enum as string
    
    class Config:
        json_encoders = {
            Industry: lambda v: v.value if v else None
        }
```

#### 2. Performance & Quality Requirements (P1-HIGH)

**Test Pass Rate Target:**
- **Current:** 55% pass rate (11 of 24 tests failing)
- **Required:** >90% pass rate (minimum 22 of 24 tests passing)
- **Action:** Fix failing tests, enhance test reliability

**Database Session Management:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Optimize session handling
# Location: app/services/organisation_service.py

@contextmanager
def database_session():
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield session
        session.commit()
    except Exception:
        session.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        session.close()
```

**Error Handling Standardization:**
```python
# Required Implementation Pattern
# Consistent error responses
# Location: app/api/api_v1/endpoints/organisations.py

@app.exception_handler(ValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=422,
        content={"detail": "Validation failed", "errors": exc.errors()}
    )
```
