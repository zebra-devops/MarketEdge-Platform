### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Industry type enumeration with safe migration
ALTER TABLE organisations 
ADD COLUMN industry_type ENUM('cinema', 'hotel', 'gym', 'b2b', 'retail', 'default') 
NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default';

CREATE INDEX ix_organisations_industry_type ON organisations (industry_type);
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
1. `POST /organisations` - Create organization with industry selection
2. `GET /current` - Retrieve current organization with industry details  
3. `PUT /current` - Update organization with industry validation
4. `DELETE /current` - Organization deletion with data cleanup
5. `GET /current/config` - Industry-specific configuration retrieval
6. `GET /industries` - Available industry types listing
7. `GET /stats` - Organization statistics by industry
