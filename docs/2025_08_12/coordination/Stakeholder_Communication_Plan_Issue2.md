## Communication Templates

### Product Owner Communication Template

**Subject**: Issue #2 Code Review Complete - Infrastructure Remediation Required Before Production

**Message**:
The Code Review for Issue #2 (Multi-tenant User Authentication with Row-level Security) has been completed with excellent results for code quality but critical infrastructure blockers identified.

**Code Review Results**:
- Quality Grade: B+ (85/100) - Excellent code implementation and architecture
- Security Implementation: High quality but cannot be validated due to infrastructure issues
- Production Status: DO NOT DEPLOY - Critical infrastructure blockers prevent safe deployment

**Infrastructure Blockers Identified**:
1. Database connectivity issues preventing security validation
2. Authentication infrastructure instability affecting JWT validation  
3. Redis integration problems affecting performance and sessions
4. Test environment misalignment preventing comprehensive testing

**Timeline Impact**:
- Production deployment delayed by 2-3 weeks
- Infrastructure remediation required before safe production deployment
- Technical Architect escalation initiated for infrastructure architecture review

**Development Status**:
- Issue #2 implementation is complete and high quality - no further development work needed
- Team can continue with other feature development while infrastructure fixes proceed
- Full re-testing required once infrastructure remediation complete

**Next Steps**:
- Technical Architect will assess infrastructure and create remediation plan
- Weekly progress updates will be provided during remediation period
- Production deployment will proceed once all infrastructure issues resolved

### Technical Architect Escalation Template

**Subject**: CRITICAL ESCALATION - Issue #2 Infrastructure Architecture Review Required

**Message**:
Technical Architect involvement required immediately for infrastructure architecture review and remediation planning for Issue #2.

**Situation**:
Code Review completed with B+ grade for implementation quality, but critical infrastructure blockers prevent production deployment. Infrastructure issues are blocking security validation, testing, and safe production deployment.

**Critical Infrastructure Issues**:
1. **Database Infrastructure**: Connectivity failures preventing RLS policy validation and tenant isolation testing
2. **Authentication Infrastructure**: JWT validation instability and authentication service reliability issues  
3. **Redis Infrastructure**: Cache layer connectivity problems affecting performance and session management
4. **Test Environment Infrastructure**: Misalignment preventing comprehensive feature validation

**Technical Impact**:
- 43% of tests failing due to infrastructure connectivity issues
- Security validation blocked due to database and authentication problems
- Production deployment unsafe due to infrastructure instability
- Development team productivity impacted by unreliable infrastructure

**Remediation Required**:
- Comprehensive infrastructure assessment and architecture review
- Infrastructure remediation plan with timeline and resource requirements
- Coordination with DevOps, Database, and Security teams
- Infrastructure monitoring and stability improvements

**Timeline**:
- Immediate assessment required to minimize production deployment delay
- Estimated 2-3 weeks for comprehensive infrastructure remediation
- Weekly progress reviews and stakeholder updates required

**Documentation Available**:
- Comprehensive Code Review report with infrastructure issue details
- Technical debt documentation with specific remediation requirements
- Post-review coordination plan with detailed next steps
