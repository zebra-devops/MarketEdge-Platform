   - Mark Issue #2 as "Code Review Approved - Proceeding to Final Validation"
   - Document Code Review approval and any recommendations

2. **Initiate Final QA Validation Phase**
   - Coordinate comprehensive final testing
   - Validate all security fixes in integrated environment
   - Confirm performance benchmarks maintained
   - Verify cross-platform integration integrity

3. **Production Readiness Assessment**
   - Execute production readiness checklist
   - Validate deployment configuration
   - Confirm monitoring and alerting setup
   - Assess rollback procedures

4. **Staged Deployment Preparation**
   - Coordinate with deployment teams
   - Prepare phased rollout strategy
   - Set up deployment monitoring
   - Establish success criteria for deployment phases

#### Timeline: 1-2 days for final validation and production readiness

### SCENARIO 2: MINOR CHANGES REQUESTED üîß

**Trigger:** Code Reviewer identifies non-critical issues requiring minor corrections

#### Immediate Actions (QA Orchestrator):
1. **Document Change Requests**
   - Capture all Code Reviewer feedback
   - Classify issues by severity and impact
   - Create detailed correction requirements

2. **Coordinate with Software Developer**
   - Provide clear, prioritized correction list
   - Establish timeline for corrections (typically 4-8 hours)
   - Monitor correction implementation progress
   - Validate corrections meet requirements

3. **Quality Re-Assessment**
   - Re-run security test suite after corrections
   - Validate >90% pass rate maintained
   - Confirm performance standards preserved
   - Test integration points remain stable

4. **Schedule Re-Review**
   - Coordinate Code Reviewer re-assessment
   - Provide updated documentation and test results
   - Facilitate expedited re-review process

#### Timeline: 1 day for corrections and re-review

### SCENARIO 3: MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED - TECHNICAL ARCHITECT ESCALATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Trigger:** Code Reviewer identifies significant architectural, security, or design concerns

#### IMMEDIATE ESCALATION PROTOCOL (per user instructions):

1. **Escalate to Technical Architect** üö®
   - **Priority:** IMMEDIATE escalation required
   - **Method:** Direct Technical Architect engagement
   - **Scope:** Comprehensive architectural and security assessment

#### QA Orchestrator Escalation Actions:
1. **Prepare Technical Architect Escalation Package**
   - Complete Code Review findings documentation
   - Security implementation analysis summary
   - Architectural concern impact assessment
   - Recommended resolution approaches

2. **Update GitHub Issue with Escalation Status**
   - Mark Issue #2 as "Escalated to Technical Architect - Major Issues Identified"
   - Document specific concerns requiring architectural guidance
   - Establish escalation timeline and expectations

3. **Coordinate Technical Architect Assessment**
   - Provide comprehensive technical context
   - Facilitate access to all relevant code and documentation
   - Schedule technical review sessions as needed
   - Monitor architectural assessment progress

4. **Manage Stakeholder Communication**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders of escalation
   - Provide regular updates on Technical Architect assessment
   - Maintain clear communication channels

#### Technical Architect Assessment Outcomes:

**Option A: Architectural Guidance Provided**
- Technical Architect provides specific guidance for resolution
- QA Orchestrator coordinates implementation with Software Developer
- Enhanced testing and validation procedures established
- Return to Code Review after architectural corrections

**Option B: Architectural Redesign Required**
- Technical Architect determines significant redesign needed
- QA Orchestrator coordinates extended development phase
- Enhanced security and architecture validation protocols
- Comprehensive re-testing and re-review cycle

**Option C: Alternative Architecture Approach**
- Technical Architect recommends different technical approach
- QA Orchestrator manages transition to alternative implementation
- Updated testing strategies and validation criteria
- Comprehensive integration validation required

#### Timeline: Variable based on Technical Architect assessment (2-5 days typical)
