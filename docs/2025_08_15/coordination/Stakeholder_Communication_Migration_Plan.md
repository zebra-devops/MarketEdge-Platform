# Railway to Render Migration - Stakeholder Communication Plan

## Executive Communication Framework

**Migration Context**: Railway platform limitations blocking multi-service architecture deployment after 5 failed attempts. Strategic migration to Render platform restores intended proxy-layer security while preserving £925K Odeon demo functionality.

**Business Impact**: Zero client disruption with enhanced enterprise-grade architecture enabling future scalability and security.

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks post-demo implementation with comprehensive risk management and rollback procedures.
