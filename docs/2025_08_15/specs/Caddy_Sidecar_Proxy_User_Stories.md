# Caddy Sidecar Proxy Implementation - User Stories

## Executive Summary

**Business Context:** £925K Odeon opportunity blocked by Railway edge proxy stripping CORS headers. 70 hours until demo presentation requires bulletproof CORS header delivery for both localhost:3001 and https://app.zebra.associates.

**Technical Solution:** Deploy Caddy reverse proxy within the same Railway service to force CORS header injection at proxy level, overriding Railway edge proxy limitations.

**Implementation Priority:** URGENT - Demo-blocking issue requiring immediate resolution with rollback strategy.
