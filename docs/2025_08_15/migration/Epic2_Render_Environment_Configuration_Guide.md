## Environment Architecture Overview

### Environment Strategy

Based on Railway configuration analysis and business requirements:

```yaml
Environment Architecture:
  
  Production Environment:
    Purpose: Live client-facing services (Odeon demo protection)
    Domain: app.zebra.associates (custom domain)
    Resource Tier: Production-grade (2GB RAM, 1+ vCPU)
    Security: Maximum security controls and monitoring
    
  Staging Environment:
    Purpose: Pre-production testing and validation
    Domain: staging.render.app subdomain
    Resource Tier: Development-grade (1GB RAM, 0.5 vCPU)
    Security: Production-equivalent security for testing
```

### Environment Isolation Requirements

```yaml
Isolation Principles:
  Data Isolation:
    - Separate PostgreSQL databases per environment
    - Separate Redis instances per environment
    - No cross-environment data sharing
    
  Security Isolation:
    - Environment-specific secrets and credentials
    - Separate Auth0 application configurations
    - Environment-specific CORS origins
    
  Resource Isolation:
    - Independent resource allocation per environment
    - Separate monitoring and alerting
    - Independent scaling and performance tuning
```

## Step 3: Environment Variable Security and Management

### 3.1 Secrets Management Strategy

#### Secret Classification
```yaml
Secret Classification:

High Sensitivity (Encrypted Secrets):
  - Database credentials and connection strings
  - Redis passwords and connection details
  - JWT secret keys
  - Auth0 client secrets
  - External service API keys
  - Encryption keys and certificates

Medium Sensitivity (Environment Variables):

  - Database and Redis URLs (without credentials)
  - External service URLs
  - Feature flags and configuration

Low Sensitivity (Public Configuration):
  - Application name and version
  - Environment identifier
  - Debug flags
  - Log levels
  - Public API endpoints
```

#### Security Best Practices Implementation
```yaml
Security Controls:

Access Controls:
  - Role-based access to environment variables
  - Audit logging for all variable changes
  - Limited team member access to production secrets
  - Separate staging and production secret access

Encryption and Storage:
  - All secrets encrypted at rest in Render
  - Secrets encrypted in transit
  - No secrets stored in code repository
  - Secret rotation procedures documented

Monitoring and Alerting:
  - Failed authentication alerts
  - Environment variable change notifications
  - Unusual access pattern monitoring
  - Secret expiration monitoring where applicable
```

### 3.2 Environment Variable Groups Organization
