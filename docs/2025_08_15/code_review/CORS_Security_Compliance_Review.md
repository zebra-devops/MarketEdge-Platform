## Security Compliance Assessment

### 1. Redundant CORS Implementations - FIXED ✅

**Previous Issue:** Multiple conflicting CORS implementations causing security gaps  
**Current Status:** **RESOLVED**

**Evidence:**
```python
# app/main.py - Lines 35-48
# Security: Environment-based CORS configuration - no hardcoded origins
# Only configure FastAPI CORS if not behind Caddy proxy (single CORS implementation)
if not os.getenv("CADDY_PROXY_MODE", "false").lower() == "true":
    logger.info(f"Security: FastAPI CORSMiddleware with environment origins: {settings.CORS_ORIGINS}")
    app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)
else:
    logger.info("Security: CORS handled by Caddy proxy - FastAPI CORS disabled")
```

**Security Validation:**
- ✅ Conditional CORS middleware based on deployment mode
- ✅ Eliminated ManualCORSMiddleware completely (line 23)
- ✅ Single source of truth for CORS configuration
- ✅ Environment-driven configuration prevents hardcoding

### 2. Docker Security Violations - FIXED ✅

**Previous Issue:** Privilege escalation and insecure container configuration  
**Current Status:** **FULLY SECURED**

**Evidence:**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile - Lines 3-4: Early user creation
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser -m -d /home/appuser appuser

# Lines 26, 33: Proper ownership during copy operations  
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser requirements.txt .
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .

# Lines 36-38: Secure directory creation with restricted permissions
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/supervisor /var/log/caddy /var/run \
    && chmod 755 /var/log/supervisor /var/log/caddy \
    && chown appuser:appuser /var/log/supervisor /var/log/caddy
```

**Security Improvements:**
- ✅ Non-root user created early for proper ownership
- ✅ Minimal package installation with cleanup
- ✅ Proper file permissions (755/644) with restricted access
- ✅ Secure log directory creation with owner restrictions
- ✅ Health check using minimal privileges

### 3. Wildcard CORS Headers - ELIMINATED ✅

**Previous Issue:** Wildcard CORS headers in error handling exposing security risks  
**Current Status:** **FULLY SECURED**

**Evidence:**
```caddyfile
# Caddyfile - Lines 116-146: Secure error handling
handle_errors {
    # Security: Only set CORS headers for known origins during errors
    @error_cors_production header Origin "https://app.zebra.associates"
    @error_cors_localhost header Origin "http://localhost:3001"
    
    handle @error_cors_production {
        header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://app.zebra.associates"
        header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
    }
    
    # Security: Generic error response without exposing internal details
    respond "Service Error" {http.error.status_code}
}
```

**Security Validation:**
- ✅ Explicit origin matching in error handlers
- ✅ No wildcard (*) headers anywhere in configuration
- ✅ Secure error responses without information disclosure
- ✅ Origin-specific CORS headers only for known domains

### 4. Complex Multi-Service Coupling - SIMPLIFIED ✅

**Previous Issue:** Complex architecture with unclear service boundaries  
**Current Status:** **ARCHITECTED CORRECTLY**

**Evidence:**
```conf
# supervisord.conf - Clean service separation
[program:fastapi]
user=appuser          # FastAPI runs as non-root
command=bash -c "./start.sh"
priority=100

[program:caddy]  
user=appuser          # Caddy runs as non-root
command=caddy run --config /app/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile
priority=200
```

**Architecture Improvements:**
- ✅ Clear service boundaries with supervisord process management
- ✅ Proper service startup order (FastAPI priority 100, Caddy priority 200)
- ✅ Non-root execution for both services
- ✅ Isolated logging and resource management

---

## Additional Security Enhancements Implemented

### 5. Script Security Hardening ✅

**Evidence:**
```bash
# start.sh - Lines 4-6: Security hardening
set -e                # Exit on error
set -u                # Treat unset variables as error  
set -o pipefail       # Fail on pipe errors

# Lines 33-37: Input validation
if ! [[ "$PORT" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [ "$PORT" -lt 1 ] || [ "$PORT" -gt 65535 ]; then
    echo "❌ Security: Invalid port number: $PORT"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 6. Network Security Improvements ✅

**Evidence:**
```bash
# start.sh - Lines 50-60: Restricted network binding
exec uvicorn app.main:app \
    --host 127.0.0.1 \              # Security: Only localhost binding
    --forwarded-allow-ips="127.0.0.1" \    # Security: Restricted proxy IPs
    --limit-concurrency 1000 \      # Security: Resource limits
    --limit-max-requests 10000 \
    --timeout-keep-alive 5
```

### 7. Environment Configuration Security ✅

**Evidence:**
```env
# .env.example - Lines 30-33: Secure CORS configuration
# Security: CORS Configuration
# Set to true when using Caddy proxy for CORS handling (production)
# Set to false for development or when FastAPI handles CORS directly
CADDY_PROXY_MODE=true
```
