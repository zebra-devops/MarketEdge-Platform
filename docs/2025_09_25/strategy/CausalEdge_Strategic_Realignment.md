# Causal Edge Strategic Realignment: From A/B Testing Platform to Consulting Sales Engine

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Prepared By:** Emma Watson, Product Strategist
**Priority:** CRITICAL - ¬£925K Zebra Associates Opportunity
**Status:** Strategic Direction Correction Required

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL PRODUCT DIRECTION MISALIGNMENT IDENTIFIED**

The current Causal Edge development trajectory focuses on building a live A/B testing platform with real-time statistical engines and POS integrations. **This is NOT the product vision.**

**ACTUAL PURPOSE:** Causal Edge is a showcase/demonstration platform to:
1. **Display the VALUE and RESULTS** that experimentation consulting can deliver
2. **Connect Zebra clients to Zebra consultants** for professional services
3. **Generate leads** for high-value consulting engagements
4. **Demonstrate ROI** of professional experimentation consulting

This document provides the corrected strategic direction, user journey redesign, and development priorities to transform Causal Edge into a powerful business development engine for Zebra Associates' consulting practice.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Been Built (Correctly) ‚úÖ
- **Basic experiment CRUD operations** (create, read, edit, archive, export)
- **"New test" creation screens** with hypothesis building
- **Database schema** supporting experiment metadata, results, conclusions
- **Multi-tenant architecture** for client isolation
- **Authentication and access control** systems

### Critical Misalignment (Requires Correction) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Technical focus on live testing infrastructure** instead of showcase capabilities
- **Statistical engine development** for real-time A/B testing (not needed)
- **POS integration planning** for live data collection (wrong direction)
- **Real-time analytics processing** (not the use case)
- **Live experiment management tools** (missing the point)

### Missing Strategic Components üö®
- **Results visualization and storytelling** capabilities
- **Business impact presentation** tools
- **Case study generation** and presentation features
- **Lead capture and consultant routing** mechanisms
- **ROI demonstration** frameworks
- **Client success story** compilation and display

## Conclusion: From Technical Tool to Business Engine

This strategic realignment transforms Causal Edge from a misguided A/B testing platform into a powerful business development engine for Zebra Associates. By focusing on **showcasing value rather than enabling testing**, we create a system that:

‚úÖ **Generates qualified leads** through compelling case studies and ROI demonstrations
‚úÖ **Connects prospects to consultants** through intelligent routing and booking systems
‚úÖ **Demonstrates clear business value** through real results and impact stories
‚úÖ **Supports the sales process** with presentation tools and proof points
‚úÖ **Measures success correctly** through business development KPIs rather than technical metrics

The ¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity depends on this strategic correction. By implementing this roadmap, we transform Causal Edge into the showcase platform it was meant to be - one that turns website visitors into qualified consulting leads and drives real revenue growth for the business.

**The question is not whether businesses want to run their own A/B tests. The question is whether they want the results that professional experimentation consulting can deliver. Causal Edge answers that question with compelling proof and connects them to the experts who can deliver those results.**
