# Preview Environment Test Document

## Test Date: 2025-09-22

### Purpose
This document validates the automatic preview environment generation via Render Blueprint configuration.

### Expected Behavior
When this PR is updated, Render should automatically:
1. Detect the PR update via webhook
2. Create a preview environment using the render.yaml Blueprint
3. Deploy the MarketEdge backend application
4. Make the preview available at a unique URL

### Test Configuration
- **Blueprint File**: `render.yaml` (corrected version from main)
- **PR Number**: #18
- **Branch**: `test/blueprint-preview-validation`
- **Service Type**: Web Service (Python)

### Validation Steps
1. ✅ PR created/updated with new commit
2. ⏳ Render webhook triggered
3. ⏳ Preview environment created
4. ⏳ Service deployed successfully
5. ⏳ Health check endpoint accessible

### Preview Environment Details
- **Expected URL Pattern**: `https://marketedge-platform-pr-18.onrender.com`
- **Health Check**: `/health`
- **API Docs**: `/docs`

### Notes
This test validates the corrected render.yaml configuration that fixed:
- Environment group schema issues
- Proper indentation for envGroups
- Preview environment configuration structure

### Business Impact
Successful preview environment generation is critical for the £925K Zebra Associates opportunity, enabling:
- Safe testing of new features
- Client demonstrations in isolated environments
- Code review with live preview URLs
- Reduced deployment risks
