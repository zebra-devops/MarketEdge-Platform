# QA Orchestrator - Issue #2 Workflow Coordination

**Issue:** #2 Client Organization Management with Industry Associations  
**Coordinated Workflow:** Software Developer → Code Reviewer → QA Orchestrator  
**Priority:** P0-Critical  
**Estimated Timeline:** 6 development days  

## QA Orchestrator Coordination Responsibilities

### 1. Development Phase Management
**Current Phase:** Development Assignment Complete
**Next Phase:** Software Developer Implementation

#### Daily Coordination Schedule
- **09:00 Daily Check-in:** Progress status with Software Developer
- **12:00 Midday Review:** Technical blocker identification and escalation
- **17:00 End-of-Day:** Progress validation and next-day planning
- **GitHub Status Updates:** Real-time issue status management

### 2. GitHub Issue Status Management

#### Status Progression Framework
```
[ ] In Development (Software Developer Phase)
    ↓
[ ] Code Review Ready (Development Complete Signal)
    ↓  
[ ] In Code Review (Code Reviewer Phase)
    ↓
[ ] QA Validation (QA Orchestrator Testing Phase)
    ↓
[ ] Production Ready (Final Validation Complete)
```

#### Issue Status Update Protocol
1. **Development Start:** Update issue with "In Development" label
2. **Daily Progress:** Comment with daily progress summary
3. **Blocker Identification:** Immediate issue update with blocker details
4. **Phase Transitions:** Update status and assign to next phase owner
5. **Completion:** Final status update with deployment readiness

### 3. Development Progress Tracking

#### Week 1 Development Timeline
**Days 1-2: Model & Database Changes**
- [ ] Organization model enhancement with industry_type enum
- [ ] Database migration creation and testing
- [ ] Model validation logic implementation
- [ ] Unit tests for model changes
- **QA Checkpoint:** Model tests passing, schema validation complete

**Days 3-4: API Implementation**

### 4. Quality Gate Management

#### Development → Code Review Handoff
**Prerequisites for Code Review:**
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical security violations

**QA Orchestrator Validation Before Handoff:**
1. Run full test suite validation
2. Verify acceptance criteria implementation
3. Validate multi-tenant isolation integrity
4. Confirm industry-specific functionality working
5. Update GitHub issue status to "Code Review Ready"

#### Code Review → QA Validation Handoff
**Prerequisites for QA Testing:**
- [ ] Code Reviewer approval received
- [ ] Security validation passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation review complete
- [ ] No architectural concerns identified

### 5. Technical Escalation Management

#### Escalation Triggers
1. **Development Blockers:** Technical implementation roadblocks
2. **Test Failures:** Persistent test failures after development
3. **Integration Issues:** Multi-tenant or industry configuration problems
4. **Performance Issues:** Response time or scalability concerns

#### Technical Architect Escalation Protocol
**When to Escalate:**
- Development blocked for >4 hours
- Test failures persist after Code Review
- Architecture questions arise during implementation
- Security or compliance concerns identified

**Escalation Process:**
1. Document specific technical issue
2. Gather relevant code and error details
3. Create Technical Architect consultation request
4. Update GitHub issue with escalation status
5. Coordinate Technical Architect recommendations back to development team

### 6. Multi-Tenant Platform Validation

#### Industry-Specific Testing Matrix
**Per Industry Validation Required:**
- Cinema: Booking system integration validation
- Hotel: PMS integration functionality
- Gym: Member management system compatibility
- B2B: CRM integration capabilities
- Retail: E-commerce platform integration

#### Tenant Isolation Validation
- [ ] Data separation between organizations
- [ ] Industry-specific feature flag isolation
- [ ] Rate limiting per industry configuration
- [ ] Security boundary enforcement
- [ ] Performance isolation validation

### 7. Communication Framework

#### Daily Progress Reporting
**To:** Product Owner, Software Developer, Code Reviewer
**Format:** 
```
## Issue #2 Daily Progress - [Date]
- **Current Phase:** [Development/Code Review/QA Validation]
- **Progress:** [Specific accomplishments]
