# Issue #2 Development Assignment: Client Organization Management with Industry Associations

**Assigned to:** Software Developer  
**Coordinated by:** QA Orchestrator  
**Priority:** P0-Critical  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Epic:** Platform Foundation & User Management  

## User Story
As a Platform Administrator, I want to create and manage client organizations with industry associations, so that each client has proper tenant isolation and industry-specific configurations.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components (Ready for Extension)
1. **Organization Model** (`app/models/organisation.py`)
   - Basic structure with `industry` field (str type)
   - SIC code integration ready
   - Rate limiting configuration in place
   - Feature flag relationships established

2. **Industry Configuration** (`app/core/industry_config.py`)
   - Comprehensive Industry enum with 5 target industries
   - Industry profiles with detailed configurations
   - SIC code mapping functionality
   - Performance and security requirements defined

3. **Organization API** (`app/api/api_v1/endpoints/organisations.py`)
   - Basic CRUD operations implemented
   - Admin authorization in place
   - Response models defined

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Model Enhancement (Priority 1)
```python
# Required changes to Organisation model:
- Replace industry: str with industry_type: Industry enum
- Add industry validation constraints
- Implement industry-specific tenant boundary logic
- Add industry configuration relationship
```

### Phase 2: API Extension (Priority 2)
```python
# Required API enhancements:
1. OrganisationCreate schema with industry_type selection
2. Industry validation endpoint
3. Industry-specific configuration retrieval
4. Organization deletion with tenant data cleanup
5. Industry association update with validation
```

### Phase 3: Industry Integration (Priority 3)
```python
# Industry-specific functionality:
1. Auto-detect industry from SIC codes
2. Apply industry-specific rate limits
3. Configure industry feature flags
4. Validate tenant boundaries by industry
5. Industry-specific security requirements
```

## Acceptance Criteria Validation Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Create client organization with industry selection (Cinema, Hotel, Gym, B2B, Retail)
- [ ] Associate industry-specific data schemas and permissions
- [ ] Validate organization setup with proper tenant boundaries
- [ ] Configure industry-specific feature flags
- [ ] Display organization details with industry context
- [ ] Edit organization settings and industry association
- [ ] Implement organization deletion with data cleanup

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Extend existing organization model with industry_type field
- [ ] Update frontend organization creation flow
- [ ] Implement industry-specific routing logic
- [ ] Add industry validation on backend
- [ ] Create organization management UI components
- [ ] Implement tenant boundary validation
- [ ] Add industry-specific feature flag logic

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation maintained across all operations
- [ ] Industry-specific configurations properly applied
- [ ] Security constraints validated for each industry
- [ ] Performance requirements met per industry profile
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and validation
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all scenarios

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Migration required:
ALTER TABLE organisations 
ADD COLUMN industry_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DEFAULT';

-- Create industry validation constraint
ALTER TABLE organisations 
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_industry_type 
CHECK (industry_type IN ('CINEMA', 'HOTEL', 'GYM', 'B2B', 'RETAIL', 'DEFAULT'));
```

### 2. Model Enhancement Priority
1. Update Organisation model with Industry enum
2. Add industry validation methods
3. Implement tenant boundary checks
4. Configure industry-specific relationships

### 3. API Development Priority
1. Create organization with industry selection
2. Industry validation and configuration retrieval
3. Organization management (update/delete)
4. Industry-specific feature flag endpoints

### 4. Integration Points
- Industry configuration manager integration
- Feature flag service industry routing
- Rate limiting industry-specific rules
- Tenant isolation validation per industry

## Development Workflow Coordination

### QA Orchestrator Responsibilities
1. **Progress Monitoring:** Daily check-ins with Software Developer
2. **GitHub Status Management:** Update issue status based on development progress
3. **Quality Gate Coordination:** Manage handoffs between development phases
4. **Blocker Escalation:** Immediate escalation of any development blockers

### Development Phases with QA Coordination
1. **Phase 1 (Days 1-2):** Model and database changes
   - QA Orchestrator validates schema compatibility
   - Progress check: Model tests passing
   
2. **Phase 2 (Days 3-4):** API implementation
   - QA Orchestrator validates endpoint functionality
   - Progress check: API tests passing
   
3. **Phase 3 (Days 5-6):** Integration and validation
   - QA Orchestrator conducts integration testing
   - Progress check: Full feature validation

### Escalation Protocol
- **If development blocked:** Immediate escalation to Technical Architect
- **If tests failing post-review:** Technical Architect analysis required
- **If integration issues:** Technical Architect recommendations needed

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- Multi-tenant isolation validated across industries
- Performance requirements met per industry profile
- Security constraints validated for all industry types
- Ready for Code Review and QA validation phases

## Next Steps
1. **Software Developer:** Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately
2. **QA Orchestrator:** Establish daily coordination schedule
3. **Daily Progress Reviews:** Monitor implementation against timeline
4. **Quality Gate Management:** Ensure proper handoffs between phases

This assignment provides the Software Developer with comprehensive technical requirements while establishing clear coordination through the QA Orchestrator for systematic progress tracking and quality assurance.
