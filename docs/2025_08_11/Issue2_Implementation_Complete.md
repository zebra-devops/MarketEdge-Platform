## Technical Implementation Details

### Industry Types Supported
1. **Cinema** (`cinema`) - Movie theaters and entertainment venues
2. **Hotel** (`hotel`) - Hospitality and accommodation services
3. **Gym** (`gym`) - Fitness and recreational facilities
4. **B2B** (`b2b`) - Business-to-business services
5. **Retail** (`retail`) - Retail and e-commerce operations
6. **Default** (`default`) - General business operations

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to organisations table
industry_type ENUM('cinema', 'hotel', 'gym', 'b2b', 'retail', 'default') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default';
CREATE INDEX ix_organisations_industry_type ON organisations (industry_type);
```

### Industry-Specific Configuration
- **Rate Limits**: Customized per industry (Cinema: 300 RPM, B2B: 500 RPM, etc.)
- **Security Requirements**: PCI compliance, audit logging, data retention policies
- **Performance Requirements**: Response time SLAs, uptime requirements
- **Compliance**: Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA for gyms, PCI DSS for retail)

### Multi-Tenant Security
- Industry type stored in database session variables
- Row-level security policies can use industry context
- Tenant isolation maintained across all operations
- Enhanced audit logging with industry information
