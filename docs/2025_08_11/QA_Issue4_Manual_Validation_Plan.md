# Issue #4 Enhanced Auth0 Integration - Manual Validation Plan

**QA Orchestrator:** Zoe  
**Issue:** #4 Enhanced Auth0 Integration  
**Environment:** Railway staging environment  
**Validation Type:** Comprehensive manual testing  
**Timeline:** 2-3 days maximum  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Executive Summary

This manual validation plan addresses the comprehensive testing of Issue #4 (Enhanced Auth0 Integration) due to persistent infrastructure issues preventing automated testing. Based on code analysis, the implementation includes:

- **Enhanced Auth0 Client** with retry logic, secure state management, and multi-tenant organization context
- **JWT Security Improvements** with unique token identifiers, token families, and enhanced validation
- **Multi-Tenant Authentication** with tenant isolation, role-based permissions, and cross-tenant access control
- **Secure Session Management** with HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, and token refresh mechanisms

## P0-CRITICAL: Multi-Tenant Security Validation

### 1. Cross-Tenant Data Isolation Testing

#### Test Scenario 1.1: Basic Tenant Isolation
**Objective:** Verify users cannot access data from other tenants

**Test Steps:**
1. Create test users in different organizations:
   - Hotel Industry User (hotel_user@test.com)
   - Cinema Industry User (cinema_user@test.com)
   - Gym Industry User (gym_user@test.com)
2. Authenticate each user and verify JWT contains correct tenant_id
3. Attempt to access other tenant's data using manipulated requests
4. Verify 403 Forbidden responses with "Cross-tenant operation not allowed"

**Expected Results:**
- Users can only access their own tenant data
- JWT tokens contain correct tenant_id matching user's organisation_id
- Cross-tenant access attempts result in 403 Forbidden errors
- Audit logs capture all cross-tenant access attempts

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Test JWT token tenant context
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOTEL_TOKEN" \
  https://staging-url.railway.app/api/v1/auth/me

# Attempt cross-tenant access (should fail)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOTEL_TOKEN" \
  https://staging-url.railway.app/api/v1/organizations/$CINEMA_ORG_ID
```

#### Test Scenario 1.2: Admin Cross-Tenant Access Control
**Objective:** Verify admin users have appropriate cross-tenant permissions

**Test Steps:**
1. Create super admin user and regular admin users
2. Test super admin access to multiple tenant contexts
3. Test regular admin access limitations to their tenant only
4. Verify admin permission boundaries and logging

**Expected Results:**
- Super admin can access cross-tenant data with proper logging
- Regular admin limited to their tenant context
- All admin actions logged with tenant context information

### 2. Authentication Security Validation

#### Test Scenario 2.1: JWT Security Features
**Objective:** Validate JWT security enhancements

**Test Steps:**
1. Authenticate and examine JWT payload structure
2. Verify unique token identifiers (jti) in each token
3. Test token type validation (access vs refresh)
4. Validate token expiration enforcement
5. Test JWT audience and issuer validation

**Expected JWT Payload:**
```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "tenant_id": "org456",
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": ["read:users", "write:users"],
  "jti": "unique-token-id",
  "iat": 1691234567,
  "exp": 1691238167,
  "type": "access",
  "iss": "market-edge-platform",
  "aud": "market-edge-api"
}
```

#### Test Scenario 2.2: Secure Token Refresh
**Objective:** Validate token refresh mechanism with rotation

**Test Steps:**
1. Authenticate and obtain access + refresh tokens
2. Use refresh token to obtain new token pair
3. Verify old refresh token is invalidated
4. Test refresh token family for rotation detection
5. Validate tenant context preservation during refresh

**Expected Results:**
- New tokens issued with updated expiration times
- Old refresh tokens invalidated after use
- Tenant context preserved across token refresh
- Token families properly tracked for security

### 3. Authorization Testing

#### Test Scenario 3.1: Role-Based Access Control
**Objective:** Validate permission system based on user roles

**Test Steps:**
1. Create users with different roles: admin, manager, viewer
2. Test endpoint access based on role requirements
3. Verify permission inheritance and industry-specific permissions
4. Test role escalation prevention

**Permission Matrix:**
| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | read:users, write:users, delete:users, manage:feature_flags |
| Manager | read:users, write:users, read:audit_logs |
| Viewer | read:organizations |

**Industry-Specific Permissions:**
- Cinema: read:cinema_data, analyze:cinema_metrics
- Hotel: read:hotel_data, analyze:hotel_metrics
- Gym: read:gym_data, analyze:gym_metrics

#### Test Scenario 3.2: Permission Enforcement
**Objective:** Verify endpoint protection with permission requirements

**Test Steps:**
1. Test protected endpoints with insufficient permissions
2. Verify proper error messages and status codes
3. Test permission boundary enforcement
4. Validate audit logging of permission violations

**Expected Results:**
- 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- Clear error messages indicating required permissions
- All permission violations logged for security audit
