# Issue #2 Technical Architect Escalation - Coordination Summary
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**QA Orchestrator:** Zoe  
**Status:** Escalation Coordinated - TA Analysis Phase Initiated

## Escalation Coordination Complete

Following the established QA workflow protocol, Issue #2 has been successfully escalated from Code Review to Technical Architect Analysis due to critical security vulnerabilities and high test failure rate identified during the Code Review phase.

## Critical Issues Requiring Technical Architect Analysis

### P0-CRITICAL Security Vulnerabilities
1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** - Industry context middleware
2. **Tenant Boundary Gaps** - Cross-tenant access risks  
3. **Missing Input Validation** - Organization endpoints
4. **Industry Enum Bypass** - Unauthorized context access

### P1-HIGH Implementation Issues
1. **45% Test Failure Rate** - 11 of 24 tests failing
2. **JSON Serialization Problems** - Industry enum handling
3. **Database Session Management** - Performance inefficiencies
4. **Missing Rate Limiting** - Critical endpoint protection
