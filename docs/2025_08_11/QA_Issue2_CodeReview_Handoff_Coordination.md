## Workflow Coordination Protocol

### Current Phase Status: CODE REVIEW 🔄
**Assigned:** Ready for Code Reviewer assignment  
**GitHub Issue:** Updated with "code-review" label  
**Documentation:** Complete development summary provided  

### Next Phase Preparation: QA VALIDATION ⏳
**Prerequisites:** Code Review completion and approval  
**QA Coordinator:** Standing by for handoff from Code Reviewer  
**Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive multi-tenant validation prepared  

### Escalation Protocol: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 🚨
**Trigger Conditions:**

3. Technical Architect provides recommendations to Software Developer
4. QA Orchestrator manages workflow transition back to Development if needed

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Multi-Tenant Security Risk:** Industry context may introduce new attack vectors
2. **Performance Risk:** Additional industry logic may impact response times
3. **Integration Risk:** Auth0 foundation changes may affect compatibility
4. **Complexity Risk:** Industry-specific features may introduce maintenance challenges

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Comprehensive Security Testing:** Focus on tenant isolation edge cases
2. **Performance Benchmarking:** Validate response times under realistic load
3. **Integration Validation:** Test all Auth0 integration points thoroughly
4. **Code Review Rigor:** Emphasize maintainability and documentation quality
