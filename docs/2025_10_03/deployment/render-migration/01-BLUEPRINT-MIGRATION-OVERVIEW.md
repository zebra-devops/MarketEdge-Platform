# Render Blueprint Migration Overview

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-03
**Author:** Maya (DevOps Agent)
**Status:** Strategic Planning

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from manually-created Render services to Blueprint-managed Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) services.

### Critical Discovery

**Render's IaC Limitation:** The Blueprint/IaC toggle only appears for services ORIGINALLY created from a `render.yaml` blueprint. Existing manually-created services CANNOT be converted to IaC management.

### Current Situation

- **Production Service:** `marketedge-platform` (manually created, no IaC capability)
- **Blueprint File:** `render.yaml` exists but cannot be applied to existing service
- **Challenge:** Creating new services means new URLs and requires migration strategy

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Strategy A: Blue-Green Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

**Description:** Create entirely new services from blueprint, test thoroughly, switch traffic, deprecate old services.

**Pros:**
- Clean slate with IaC management from day one
- Can fully test new services before switching traffic
- True zero-downtime deployment with instant rollback capability
- Eliminates technical debt from manual configuration
- Proper separation between old and new infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Requires careful coordination of DNS/traffic switching
- Temporary duplication of resources (cost consideration)
- More complex migration process
- Requires comprehensive testing of new services

**Risk Level:** Medium (mitigated by thorough testing)

**Timeline Estimate:**
- Implementation Readiness: Immediate (documentation complete)
- Agent Sequence: devops → dev → qa-orch validation
- Complexity Assessment: Moderate

### Strategy B: Staged Migration

**Description:** Keep production as-is, create new staging from blueprint, test IaC workflow, migrate production later.

**Pros:**
- Lower immediate risk to production
- Allows validation of IaC workflow on staging first
- Production remains stable during transition
- Gradual learning curve for team

**Cons:**
- Production remains manually managed (blocks IaC benefits)
- Requires eventual production migration anyway (deferred work)
- Mixed infrastructure management model (complexity)
- Staging and production diverge in management approach

**Risk Level:** Low (conservative approach)

**Timeline Estimate:**
- Implementation Readiness: Immediate
- Agent Sequence: devops → validation
- Complexity Assessment: Simple

## Recommendation: Strategy A (Blue-Green Deployment)

**Rationale:**

1. **IaC Benefits Immediate:** Production gains version-controlled infrastructure immediately
2. **Technical Debt Elimination:** Removes manual configuration inconsistencies
3. **Future-Proof:** All environments managed consistently via blueprint
4. **Rollback Safety:** Old services remain available during transition
5. **Cost-Effective Long-Term:** Short-term resource duplication is acceptable for long-term benefits

### Success Criteria

- [ ] New services deployed from blueprint with IaC toggle enabled
- [ ] All environment variables migrated and verified
- [ ] Database connections established and tested
- [ ] Custom domains switched with zero downtime
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional on new services
- [ ] Old services deprecated after successful verification period

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Pre-Migration)
- Update render.yaml with new service names
- Document all current environment variables
- Create database migration plan
- Prepare rollback procedures
- **Agent Coordination:** devops planning

### Phase 2: Blueprint Deployment
- Create branch for blueprint migration
- Deploy new services from render.yaml
- Verify IaC toggle enabled
- **Agent Coordination:** devops → dev validation

### Phase 3: Configuration & Testing
- Transfer environment variables
- Configure database connections
- Run smoke tests
- Execute integration tests
- **Agent Coordination:** dev → qa-orch validation

### Phase 4: Traffic Migration
- Set up custom domain on new service
- Gradual traffic cutover (DNS TTL consideration)
- Monitor performance and errors
- **Agent Coordination:** devops monitoring

### Phase 5: Verification & Cleanup
- 72-hour stability monitoring
- Verify all functionality
- Deprecate old services
- Update documentation
- **Agent Coordination:** qa-orch final validation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Database Connection Switch**
   - Risk: Application downtime if connection fails
   - Mitigation: Test connection before traffic switch, keep old service running

2. **Environment Variable Migration**
   - Risk: Missing or incorrect secrets cause service failure
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive checklist, automated verification script

3. **Custom Domain DNS Propagation**
   - Risk: DNS caching causes intermittent availability
   - Mitigation: Lower TTL 24 hours before migration, monitor DNS propagation

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Auth0 Callback URL Update**
   - Risk: Authentication failures if callbacks not updated
   - Mitigation: Pre-configure Auth0 with both old and new URLs

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Risk: Frontend requests blocked by CORS policy
   - Mitigation: Include all frontend domains in new service CORS config

### Low-Risk Areas

1. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Risk: Temporary loss of metrics during transition
   - Mitigation: Configure monitoring before traffic switch

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (During Migration)
1. Revert DNS changes to old service
2. Verify old service still functional
3. Investigate new service issues
4. Estimated rollback time: 5-10 minutes (DNS TTL dependent)

### Post-Migration Rollback (After Traffic Switch)
1. Switch DNS back to old service
2. Old service remains running for 72 hours post-migration
3. All data in shared database (no data loss)
4. Estimated rollback time: 10-15 minutes

## Cost Analysis

### Temporary Cost Increase (Migration Period)

**Duration:** 72 hours (3 days) overlap period

**Additional Costs:**
- Duplicate web services: Free tier (no additional cost)
- Duplicate databases: Free tier staging DB already exists
- Total Additional Cost: $0 (using free tier for migration)

**Note:** Render free tier allows sufficient resources for temporary duplication during migration.

### Long-Term Cost Impact

**No Change:** Same service plans after migration (free tier production, free tier staging)

## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation:** All stakeholders review migration strategy
2. **Create Updated Blueprint:** Generate new render.yaml with migration-specific naming
3. **Schedule Migration Window:** Identify low-traffic period for final cutover
4. **Execute Pre-Migration Checklist:** Verify all prerequisites complete
5. **Begin Phase 1:** Update render.yaml and prepare for blueprint deployment
