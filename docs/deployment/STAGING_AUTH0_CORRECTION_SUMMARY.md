# Staging Auth0 Configuration Correction Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Performed By:** Maya (DevOps Engineer)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Successfully analyzed production environment variables and created corrected staging configuration with proper Auth0 Client ID.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Auth0 Client ID Correction
- **Previous (WRONG):** `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (PlatformWrapper-dev)
- **Corrected (RIGHT):** `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP` (PlatformWrapper-Staging)

### 2. Environment-Specific Variables Updated
- **AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL:** Changed to `https://staging.zebra.associates/callback`
- **CORS_ORIGINS:** Updated to include staging domains
- **ENVIRONMENT:** Set to `staging`
- **DATABASE_URL:** Placeholder for staging database
- **REDIS_URL:** Placeholder for staging Redis

## Files Created

1. **`/docs/deployment/STAGING_ENV_VARS.env`**
   - Complete staging environment variable configuration
   - Ready for import into Render Dashboard

2. **`/docs/deployment/STAGING_VS_PRODUCTION_ANALYSIS.md`**
   - Detailed comparison of production vs staging variables
   - Shows which variables differ and which can be shared

3. **`/docs/deployment/RENDER_STAGING_IMPORT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**
   - Step-by-step guide for importing to Render
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues

4. **`/docs/deployment/AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_CORRECTION.md`** (Updated)
   - Added 2025-10-03 analysis section
   - Documented production environment findings
   - Listed all correction actions taken

## Production Environment Analysis Results

From `/Users/matt/Downloads/production-env (1).env`:

- Production uses: `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr`
- Staging values present but unused: `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_STAGING=9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP`
- Database: `marketedge_production`
- Redis: `redis://red-d2gfer3uibrs73eai6og:6379`

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Render Dashboard Actions
```bash
# Steps to complete:
1. Navigate to Render Dashboard
2. Create new Environment Group: "staging-env"
3. Import STAGING_ENV_VARS.env
4. Replace placeholders:
   - DATABASE_URL with staging database
   - REDIS_URL with staging Redis
5. Link to staging service
```

### 2. Required Updates
- [ ] Create staging database in Render
- [ ] Create staging Redis instance
- [ ] Configure staging.zebra.associates domain
- [ ] Link staging-env group to service
- [ ] Deploy and test authentication

### 3. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Auth0 login works with corrected client ID
- [ ] Staging domain callbacks function
- [ ] Database connects to staging instance
- [ ] Redis connects to staging instance
- [ ] Environment shows "staging" in health check

## Key Configuration Values

### Staging Auth0 Application
- **Name:** PlatformWrapper-Staging
- **Client ID:** `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP`
- **Client Secret:** `xrdILihwwXxXNqDjxEa65J1aSjExjC4PNRzxUAVcvy3K9OcwhT_FVEqwziA-bQa7`
- **Domain:** dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com
- **Callback:** https://staging.zebra.associates/callback

### Staging Environment
- **URL:** https://staging.zebra.associates
- **Backend:** https://marketedge-staging.onrender.com
- **Environment:** staging
- **CORS:** Configured for staging domains

## Testing Commands

```bash
# After deployment, test with:

# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://marketedge-staging.onrender.com/health

# 2. Verify Auth0 configuration
curl https://marketedge-staging.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/auth0-url?redirect_uri=https://staging.zebra.associates/callback

# Should see client_id=9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP in the URL

# 3. Test login flow
# Navigate to https://staging.zebra.associates and test login
```

## Risk Mitigation

- ✅ Staging values kept separate from production
- ✅ Database and Redis isolated per environment
- ✅ Clear documentation for rollback if needed
- ✅ Verification steps before going live
