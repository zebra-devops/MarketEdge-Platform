## Quick Reference

### Critical Configuration (MUST DO FIRST)

**AUTH0_AUDIENCE Configuration:**
```bash
# Location: Render Dashboard â†’ marketedge-platform â†’ Environment
Key: AUTH0_AUDIENCE
Value: https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/

# Time: 5 minutes
# Impact: Without this, authentication WILL FAIL
```

**CORS Configuration:**
```bash
# Location: Render Dashboard â†’ marketedge-platform â†’ Environment
Key: CORS_ORIGINS
Value: (add) https://*.vercel.app

# Time: 5 minutes
# Impact: Without this, frontend requests will be blocked
```

**Auth0 Callback URLs:**
```bash
# Location: Auth0 Dashboard â†’ Applications â†’ Settings
# Add: https://*.vercel.app/callback, https://*.onrender.com/callback

# Time: 10 minutes
# Impact: Without this, preview/staging authentication will fail
```

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Developer Deploys New Feature

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Develop and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 3. Open PR to staging (not main!)
# GitHub UI: New PR â†’ base: staging

# 4. After approval, merge to staging
# Staging auto-deploys in 5-10 minutes

# 5. Test in staging
# https://staging.zebra.associates

# 6. When ready for production:
# - Open PR from staging to main
# - Merge to main
# - Create GitHub Release tag (v1.0.0)
# - Production auto-deploys from tag
```

---

### Scenario 2: Emergency Hotfix

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# 2. Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical bug"

# 3. Fast-track through staging
# PR to staging â†’ merge â†’ verify

# 4. PR to main â†’ merge â†’ create release
# Or: bypass staging with approval (extreme emergencies only)
```

---

### Scenario 3: Production Rollback

```bash
# Option 1: Automated rollback (preferred)
# GitHub Actions â†’ Production Rollback â†’ Run workflow

# Option 2: Manual via Render
# Dashboard â†’ Production Service â†’ Deployments â†’ Redeploy previous

# Option 3: Via Git tag
git tag -a v1.0.0-rollback -m "Rollback to v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0-rollback
```
