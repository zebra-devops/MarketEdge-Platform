## Current State Risks (Without Staging Gate)

### Risk CS-1: Direct Production Deployment

**Severity:** HIGH
**Probability:** HIGH (ongoing)
**Status:** EXISTING RISK

**Description:**
Current deployment process deploys directly to production from `main` branch without intermediate UAT stage. This creates high risk of production incidents from untested code.

**Impact:**
- Production bugs affect all users immediately
- No opportunity for stakeholder validation
- High cost of production incidents
- Potential data corruption
- Customer trust impact

**Mitigation (Current):**
- PR preview environments
- Zebra smoke tests on PR
- Code review process

**Mitigation (Proposed):**
- Staging gate provides UAT environment
- Tag-based production releases
- Automated smoke tests at each stage

**Risk Score:** HIGH x HIGH = **CRITICAL**

---

### Risk CS-2: No Release Control

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** HIGH (ongoing)
**Status:** EXISTING RISK

**Description:**
No formal release management process. Production deploys automatically on merge to `main`. No versioning, no release notes, no controlled cadence.

**Impact:**
- Difficult to track what's deployed
- No clear rollback point
- No communication of changes
- Difficult to coordinate releases

**Mitigation (Current):**
- Git commit history

**Mitigation (Proposed):**
- Tag-based releases with version numbers
- GitHub Release notes
- Controlled release cadence

**Risk Score:** MEDIUM x HIGH = **MEDIUM-HIGH**

---

### Risk CS-3: Missing Auth0 Audience Configuration

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Probability:** HIGH (current state)
**Status:** EXISTING CRITICAL GAP

**Description:**
AUTH0_AUDIENCE environment variable not configured. Auth0 returns opaque tokens instead of JWT tokens. Authentication will fail after token exchange.

**Impact:**
- Authentication completely broken
- All users unable to login
- Â£925K Zebra opportunity at risk
- Production downtime

**Mitigation (Current):**
- None (critical gap)

**Mitigation (Required IMMEDIATELY):**
- Configure AUTH0_AUDIENCE in Render production
- Value: `https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/`
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

**Risk Score:** CRITICAL x HIGH = **CRITICAL**
**Action Required:** IMMEDIATE (before any deployment)

---

## Implementation Risks (During Staging Gate Rollout)

### Risk IM-1: Breaking Existing PR Preview Workflow

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** LOW
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION RISK

**Description:**
Changes to deployment infrastructure might break existing PR preview environments that developers rely on daily.

**Impact:**
- Developer productivity impacted
- PR review process disrupted
- Team frustration with new process
- Rollback to old process needed

**Mitigation:**
- Phased implementation (staging gate runs in parallel)
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test PR preview workflow in Phase 4
- Keep old process available during transition
- Clear rollback plan documented

**Contingency:**
- If PR previews break: immediately rollback changes
- Fix issues in isolation
- Re-test before re-enabling

**Risk Score:** MEDIUM x LOW = **LOW**

---

### Risk IM-2: Staging Database Synchronization Issues

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION RISK

**Description:**
Staging database schema or data may drift from production, causing false positive tests in staging that fail in production.

**Impact:**
- Staging tests pass but production fails
- False confidence in staging validation
- Production incidents despite staging gate
- Increased rollback rate

**Mitigation:**
- Schema-only sync (via migrations)
- Do NOT copy production data
- Use test data in staging
- Regular schema validation
- Migration testing in CI

**Monitoring:**
- Compare alembic versions across environments
- Weekly schema diff check
- Alert on migration drift

**Risk Score:** MEDIUM x MEDIUM = **MEDIUM**

---

### Risk IM-3: Cost Overrun

**Severity:** LOW
**Probability:** LOW
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION RISK

**Description:**
Additional infrastructure (staging Render service, staging database) increases monthly costs.

**Impact:**
- Increased operational costs
- Budget approval needed
- Potential cost-cutting pressure

**Estimated Costs:**
- Staging Render service: $0-7/month (Free or Starter plan)
- Staging database: $0-7/month (Free or Starter plan)
- Total increase: $0-14/month
- Current: $0-260/month
- New total: $0-274/month (0-5% increase)

**Mitigation:**
- Use free tiers where possible
- Monitor usage monthly
- Auto-scale down if not used
- ROI: Cost of staging << Cost of production incident

**Risk Score:** LOW x LOW = **LOW**

---

### Risk IM-4: Team Workflow Disruption

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION RISK

**Description:**
New deployment process requires team to learn new workflow. Potential for confusion, resistance, or incorrect usage during transition.

**Impact:**
- Slower deployment velocity initially
- Team frustration
- Mistakes in deployment process
- Potential for incorrect releases

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive training sessions
- Clear documentation (runbook, user guide)
- Gradual rollout (optional use first)
- Support channel for questions
- Pair programming for first few releases
- Regular check-ins during transition

**Transition Plan:**
- Week 5: Announce new process
- Week 5-6: Optional use, old process still available
- Week 7+: Mandatory staging gate, old process deprecated

**Risk Score:** MEDIUM x MEDIUM = **MEDIUM**

---

### Risk IM-5: Production Deployment Downtime

**Severity:** HIGH
**Probability:** LOW
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION RISK

**Description:**
During cutover to tag-based deployment, potential for misconfiguration causing production downtime.

**Impact:**

**Mitigation:**
- Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- Phased cutover (test in staging first)
- Keep old deployment process as fallback
- Cutover during low-traffic period
- Immediate rollback plan
- Pre-cutover validation checklist

**Contingency:**
- If production goes down: immediate rollback
- Manual deployment via Render dashboard
- 24/7 on-call support during cutover

**Risk Score:** HIGH x LOW = **MEDIUM**

---

## Operational Risks (Post-Implementation)

### Risk OP-1: Staging Environment Down

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** LOW
**Status:** OPERATIONAL RISK

**Description:**
Staging environment becomes unavailable (Render outage, misconfiguration, database issue), blocking deployments.

**Impact:**

- Development velocity impacted
- Hotfixes delayed
- Team frustration

**Mitigation:**
- Health monitoring for staging
- Alerts on staging downtime
- Bypass procedure for emergency hotfixes
- Manual testing fallback
- Staging SLA monitoring

**Bypass Procedure:**
```bash
# For critical hotfixes only, with tech lead approval
# 1. Create PR directly to main (bypass staging)
# 2. Document reason for bypass
# 3. Extra scrutiny in code review
# 4. Manual testing checklist
# 5. Deploy with extra monitoring
```

**Risk Score:** MEDIUM x LOW = **LOW**

---

### Risk OP-2: False Positive in Staging Smoke Tests
