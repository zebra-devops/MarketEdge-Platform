# Auth0 Client ID Correction - Summary Report

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Prepared By:** Maya (DevOps Engineer)
**Issue:** Incorrect Auth0 client ID documented in multiple files
**Status:** ✅ CORRECTED

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully corrected Auth0 client ID references across the MarketEdge Platform deployment documentation and configuration files. The main issue was a typo in the production frontend client ID (`mQG01Z4l...` instead of `mQG0IZ41...`) and incorrect staging client ID usage.

**Impact:**
- ✅ All documentation now references correct Auth0 application client IDs
- ✅ Frontend configuration files updated with correct production client ID
- ✅ Staging configuration updated to use dedicated staging Auth0 application
- ✅ Backend configuration clarified with comments explaining client ID strategy

---

## Correct Auth0 Client IDs (Verified from Auth0 Dashboard)

| Environment | Application Name | Client ID | Usage |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Production** | PlatformWrapperAuth | `mQG0IZ41NhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr` | Frontend production |
| **Staging** | PlatformWrapper-Staging | `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP` | Frontend staging |
| **Development/Preview** | PlatformWrapper-dev | `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` | Local dev, PR previews, **backend all environments** |

## What Was Wrong

### Issue #1: Typo in Production Frontend Client ID

**Documented (INCORRECT):**
```
mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr
      ^^^^
```

**Actual (CORRECT):**
```
mQG0IZ41NhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr
     ^^^^
```

**Character Differences:**
- Incorrect: `01Z4` (zero-one-zee-four)
- Correct: `0IZ4` (zero-eye-zee-four)

**Impact:** Copy-paste from documentation would result in authentication failures with "Invalid client_id" errors from Auth0.

### Issue #2: Staging Using Production Client ID

**Before:**
- Staging environment configured with production client ID `mQG01Z4l...` (also had typo)

**After:**
- Staging now uses dedicated `PlatformWrapper-Staging` application: `9FRjf82e...`

**Impact:** Proper environment separation, dedicated callback URLs, separate Auth0 application logs.

### Issue #3: Backend vs Frontend Client ID Strategy Not Documented

**Before:**
- No clear documentation of why backend uses different client ID than frontend
- Confusion about which client ID to use in which environment

**After:**
- Clear documentation in render.yaml explaining:
  - Backend uses `PlatformWrapper-dev` for ALL environments (environment-agnostic)
  - Frontend uses environment-specific client IDs (production, staging, dev)
  - Rationale explained: Backend is environment-agnostic, frontend differentiates

## Auth0 Client ID Strategy (Clarified)

### Backend Strategy (Render)

**All Environments Use:** `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (PlatformWrapper-dev)

| Environment | Client ID | Application |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Production | `wEgjaOnk...` | PlatformWrapper-dev |
| Staging | `wEgjaOnk...` | PlatformWrapper-dev |
| Preview | `wEgjaOnk...` | PlatformWrapper-dev |

**Rationale:**
- Backend is environment-agnostic
- Single Auth0 application simplifies backend configuration
- All callback URLs configured in one Auth0 app
- Client secret shared across environments (managed in Render Dashboard per environment)

### Frontend Strategy (Vercel)

**Environment-Specific Client IDs:**

| Environment | Client ID | Application |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Production | `mQG0IZ41...` | PlatformWrapperAuth |
| Staging | `9FRjf82e...` | PlatformWrapper-Staging |
| Development/Preview | `wEgjaOnk...` | PlatformWrapper-dev |

**Rationale:**
- Frontend differentiates environments via client ID
- Separate Auth0 applications for production and staging
- Dedicated callback URLs per environment
- Better security (production secrets separate from staging)
- Clearer Auth0 logs (separated by environment)

## Required Dashboard Verification

### Vercel Dashboard (Frontend)

**Production Environment Variables:**
- [ ] Navigate to: Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables → Production
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` = `mQG0IZ41NhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr`
- [ ] If incorrect, update to correct production client ID

**Preview/Staging Environment Variables:**
- [ ] Navigate to: Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables → Preview
- [ ] For staging branch, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` = `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP`
- [ ] For other preview branches, use `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6`

### Render Dashboard (Backend)

**Production Service:**
- [x] **CURRENT:** Uses `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (PlatformWrapper-dev)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Navigate to Render → marketedge-platform → Environment
- [ ] Confirm `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` matches documented strategy
- [ ] Confirm `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` matches chosen client ID application

**Staging Service (when created):**
- [ ] Set `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` = `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (same as production backend)
- [ ] Set `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` = same as dev client secret
- [ ] Or optionally use dedicated staging client ID `9FRjf82e...` with separate secret

### Auth0 Dashboard

**Verify Applications Exist:**
- [x] PlatformWrapperAuth exists with client ID `mQG0IZ41NhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr`
- [x] PlatformWrapper-Staging exists with client ID `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP`
- [x] PlatformWrapper-dev exists with client ID `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6`

**Verify Callback URLs Configured:**
- [ ] PlatformWrapper-dev has wildcard callbacks: `https://*.onrender.com/callback`, `https://*.vercel.app/callback`
- [ ] PlatformWrapper-Staging has staging callback: `https://staging.zebra.associates/callback`
- [ ] PlatformWrapperAuth has production callbacks: `https://app.zebra.associates/callback`

## Key Corrections Made

### Production Frontend Client ID
- ❌ **OLD (TYPO):** `mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr`
- ✅ **NEW (CORRECT):** `mQG0IZ41NhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr`

### Staging Frontend Client ID
- ❌ **OLD (WRONG APP):** `mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr` (production with typo)
- ✅ **NEW (CORRECT):** `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP` (dedicated staging)

### Backend Client ID (All Environments)
- ✅ **CONFIRMED CORRECT:** `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (PlatformWrapper-dev)
- ✅ **DOCUMENTED:** Strategy explained in render.yaml comments

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Check production environment variables have correct client ID
   - Check staging/preview environment variables have correct client IDs

2. **Verify Render Dashboard:**
   - Confirm production backend uses dev client ID (current strategy)
   - When creating staging, use same dev client ID (or switch to dedicated)

3. **Test Authentication:**
   - Test production login at app.zebra.associates
   - Test staging login when staging.zebra.associates is deployed
   - Test local development login

4. **Monitor for Issues:**
   - Watch for "Invalid client_id" errors (indicates wrong client ID)
   - Watch for "Callback URL mismatch" errors (indicates callback not configured)
   - Verify Auth0 logs show correct application being used

---

## Auth0 Domain (Unchanged)

**Auth0 Tenant:** `dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com`

**Auth0 Audience:** `https://dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com/api/v2/`

Both values are CORRECT and require no changes.

---

## Security Notes

### Client Secrets

**IMPORTANT:** Each Auth0 application has its own client secret.

| Application | Client ID | Secret Location |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| PlatformWrapper-dev | `wEgjaOnk...` | Render Dashboard (all backend environments) |
| PlatformWrapper-Staging | `9FRjf82e...` | Not used by backend, frontend is public |
| PlatformWrapperAuth | `mQG0IZ41...` | Not used by backend, frontend is public |

**Current Backend Strategy:**
- Backend uses PlatformWrapper-dev client secret for all environments
- Client secret configured separately in each Render environment (production, staging, preview)
- Same secret value across environments (from PlatformWrapper-dev app)

### Never Commit Secrets
- ❌ Never commit client secrets to git
- ✅ Client secrets managed in Render Dashboard
- ✅ Frontend client IDs are public (no secret needed)

---

## Conclusion

Successfully corrected all Auth0 client ID references across deployment documentation and configuration files. The corrections ensure:

1. **Accurate Documentation:** All docs reference correct client IDs
2. **Proper Configuration:** Frontend uses environment-specific client IDs
3. **Clear Strategy:** Backend vs frontend approach documented
4. **Reduced Errors:** No more copy-paste authentication failures

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Deployment Impact:** MEDIUM - Frontend configuration files updated, Vercel dashboard verification needed

**Testing Required:** Yes - authentication testing in all environments after Vercel dashboard verification
