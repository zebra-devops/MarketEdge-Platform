# Current State Analysis - MarketEdge Platform Deployment Infrastructure

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Prepared By:** Maya (DevOps Engineer)
**Repository:** zebra-devops/MarketEdge-Platform
**Current Branch:** test/trigger-zebra-smoke

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the MarketEdge Platform's current deployment infrastructure, identifying the existing setup, workflows, environment configurations, and gaps compared to the proposed staging gate architecture.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Strong Foundation:** Well-configured PR preview environments on both Render and Vercel
- ✅ **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive Zebra smoke tests protecting the £925K opportunity
- ⚠️ **No Staging Environment:** Currently only have `main` branch (production) and PR previews
- ⚠️ **No Staging Gate:** No intermediate UAT environment between PR preview and production
- ❌ **Branch-Based Production:** Direct deployments from `main` branch without release tags

---

## 1. Current Git Branching Strategy

### 1.1 Branch Structure

**Current Active Branches:**
```
main (production branch)
├── test/trigger-zebra-smoke (current feature branch)
├── feature/staging-environment-validation
└── test-staging-validation
```

**Remote Branches:**
```
origin/main (production)
origin/test/trigger-zebra-smoke
origin/feature/staging-environment-validation
origin/test-staging-validation
```

### 1.2 Current Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Feature Branch] -->|PR| B[main]
    B -->|Auto-deploy| C[Production]
    A -->|Auto-deploy| D[PR Preview]
```

**Current Flow:**
1. Developer creates feature branch from `main`
2. Developer pushes commits to feature branch
3. Render + Vercel automatically create preview environments
4. Developer opens PR to `main`
5. Zebra smoke tests run on PR
6. After PR approval and merge to `main`, auto-deploys to production

**Problems with Current Flow:**
- ❌ No staging gate for UAT testing
- ❌ No intermediate environment for stakeholder validation
- ❌ Production deploys immediately after merge (no release control)
- ❌ No tag-based release management
- ❌ High risk of production issues from untested integration scenarios

### 1.3 Branch Protection Rules

**Status:** Not documented/verified
**Required Analysis:** Need to check GitHub repository settings for:
- Branch protection on `main`
- Required status checks
- Required reviewers
- Force push restrictions
- Merge strategies (squash vs merge commit)

---

## 3. Current Deployment Configuration

### 3.1 Render Backend Configuration

**File:** `/render.yaml`

**Service Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: marketedge-platform
    env: python-3.11
    plan: free
    buildCommand: python --version && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: ./render-startup.sh
```

**Preview Environment:**
```yaml
previews:
  generation: automatic  # ✅ Automatic PR previews
  expireAfterDays: 7     # ✅ Auto-cleanup
```

**Preview Features:**
- ✅ Automatic preview creation for every PR
- ✅ Separate preview databases
- ✅ Environment-specific Auth0 configuration
- ✅ 7-day automatic cleanup
- ✅ Wildcard CORS for preview URLs

**Environment Variables (Production):**
```yaml
AUTH0_DOMAIN: dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: (from secrets)
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET: (from secrets)
AUTH0_ACTION_SECRET: (from secrets)
AUTH0_AUDIENCE: ⚠️ MISSING (critical gap)
DATABASE_URL: (from environment group)
REDIS_URL: (from environment group)
CORS_ORIGINS: https://platform.marketedge.co.uk,https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com
USE_STAGING_AUTH0: false
```

**Environment Variables (Preview):**
```yaml
USE_STAGING_AUTH0: true (automatic)
CORS_ORIGINS: https://*.onrender.com,https://localhost:3000 (wildcard support)
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING: true
```

**Critical Configuration Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **AUTH0_AUDIENCE missing** - Required for JWT tokens (currently returns opaque tokens)
2. ⚠️ **No staging-specific Auth0 tenant** - Uses same Auth0 tenant for prod and staging
3. ⚠️ **CORS_ORIGINS incomplete** - Missing Vercel domains
4. ⚠️ **No separate staging service** - Only production + previews

### 3.2 Vercel Frontend Configuration

**Vercel Project ID:** `prj_MywzQ7mcvWoOWMAdnTnbOnivyhtD`
**Vercel Org ID:** `team_1TUAsFQzZUxGWN0ItsbXMqFv`

**Configuration Files Found:**

**1. Production Configuration (vercel-deployment-config.json):**
```json
{
  "name": "marketedge-frontend",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL": "https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN": "dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID": "mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr"
  }
}
```

**2. Staging Configuration (vercel-staging.json):**
```json
{
  "name": "marketedge-frontend-staging",
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "staging",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT": "staging",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL": "https://staging-api.zebra.associates",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN": "dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID": "mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr"
  },
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "develop": true,
      "staging": true
    }
  },
  "aliases": [
    "staging.zebra.associates"
  ]
}
```

**Configuration Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **Staging backend URL mismatch** - Points to non-existent `https://staging-api.zebra.associates`
2. ⚠️ **No `staging` branch exists** - Configuration references non-existent branch
3. ⚠️ **No `develop` branch exists** - Configuration references non-existent branch
4. ✅ Custom domain configured: `staging.zebra.associates`

### 3.3 Current Environment Matrix

**Actual Environments:**

| Environment | Backend URL | Frontend URL | Database | Auth0 Tenant | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Production | marketedge-platform.onrender.com | (not deployed) | Production DB | dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8 | ✅ Active |
| PR Preview | marketedge-platform-pr-N.onrender.com | *-marketedge-*.vercel.app | Preview DB | dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8 | ✅ Active |
| Staging | ❌ Does not exist | ❌ Does not exist | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ❌ Missing |
| Development | localhost:8000 | localhost:3000 | Local DB | dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8 | ✅ Active |

**Planned Environments (from vercel-staging.json):**

| Environment | Backend URL | Frontend URL | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Staging | staging-api.zebra.associates | staging.zebra.associates | ❌ Not created |

## 4. Database Infrastructure

### 4.1 Current Database Setup

**Production Database:**
- Provider: Not explicitly documented (likely Render managed PostgreSQL)
- Configuration: Via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Migrations: Alembic (`alembic upgrade head`)
- Seeds: `database/seeds/initial_data.py` + `database/seeds/phase3_data.py`

**Preview Databases:**
- Strategy: Automatic preview database per PR (Render feature)
- Lifecycle: Created on PR open, deleted after 7 days
- Migrations: Run automatically via `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true` in render.yaml
- Seeds: Seeded via startup script

**Database Migration Testing:**
- ✅ CI workflow validates migrations on fresh database
- ✅ Tests migration rollback safety
- ✅ Validates schema completeness (`alembic check`)

### 4.2 Database Strategy Gaps

**Missing Components:**
- ❌ Staging database (separate from production)
- ❌ Database backup verification workflow
- ❌ Database restore procedure documentation
- ❌ Data synchronization strategy (prod → staging)
- ❌ PII/sensitive data handling for non-prod environments
- ❌ Database performance monitoring
- ❌ Long-running query detection

---

## 5. Auth0 Configuration

### 5.1 Current Auth0 Setup

**Auth0 Tenant:**
- Domain: `dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com`
- Application: MarketEdge Platform
- Client ID: `wEgjaOnk8MSgRTdaWURNKaFu80MG0Sa6` (backend)
- Client ID: `mQG01Z4lNhTTN081GHbR9R9C4fBQdPNr` (frontend)

**Callback URLs (Inferred):**
```
http://localhost:3000/callback (development)
https://app.zebra.associates/callback (production)
https://platform.marketedge.co.uk/callback (production)
https://*.onrender.com/callback (preview - needs verification)
https://*.vercel.app/callback (preview - needs verification)
```

**Critical User:**
- Email: matt.lindop@zebra.associates
- Role: super_admin
- Business Value: £925K Zebra Associates opportunity
- Protection: Dedicated smoke test workflow

### 5.2 Auth0 Configuration Gaps

**Missing Configuration:**
1. ❌ **Separate staging Auth0 tenant** - Best practice for staging isolation
2. ⚠️ **AUTH0_AUDIENCE not configured** - Critical for JWT tokens (CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED)
3. ⚠️ **Wildcard callback URLs not verified** - May block preview environments
4. ❌ **No Auth0 Action testing in CI** - Actions call backend `/api/v1/auth/user-context`
5. ❌ **No Auth0 monitoring/alerting** - No visibility into Auth0 errors

**Environment-Specific Auth0 Strategy:**
- Currently uses `USE_STAGING_AUTH0` flag to switch between production and staging config
- Staging config variables defined but not fully utilized:
  - `AUTH0_DOMAIN_STAGING`
  - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_STAGING`
  - `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET_STAGING`
  - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE_STAGING`

## 14. Risk Assessment

### 14.1 Current State Risks

**High-Risk Issues:**
1. ❌ **Direct production deployment** - No intermediate testing stage
2. ❌ **No UAT environment** - Stakeholders cannot validate before production
3. ❌ **AUTH0_AUDIENCE missing** - Authentication will fail (CRITICAL)
4. ⚠️ **Branch-based deploy** - No release control or versioning

**Medium-Risk Issues:**
1. ⚠️ No post-deployment smoke tests
2. ⚠️ No automated rollback
3. ⚠️ CORS configuration incomplete
4. ⚠️ No monitoring/alerting
5. ⚠️ No database backup verification

**Low-Risk Issues:**
1. Limited test coverage in CI
2. No performance testing
3. No security scanning
4. Documentation gaps

### 14.2 Migration Risks (Introducing Staging Gate)

**High-Risk Migration Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **Breaking existing preview workflow** - Must maintain PR preview functionality
2. ⚠️ **Database synchronization** - Keeping staging database in sync with production
3. ⚠️ **Cost overrun** - Additional infrastructure costs
4. ⚠️ **Team workflow disruption** - Learning new deployment process

**Medium-Risk Migration Issues:**
1. ⚠️ DNS configuration for staging domain
2. ⚠️ Auth0 callback URL configuration
3. ⚠️ Environment variable management
4. ⚠️ Branch protection rule updates

**Low-Risk Migration Issues:**
1. Documentation updates
2. Team training
3. Workflow file creation

### 14.3 Mitigation Strategies

**For Current Risks:**
1. Implement staging gate to reduce production deployment risk
2. Add post-deployment smoke tests
3. Configure AUTH0_AUDIENCE immediately
4. Implement monitoring and alerting

**For Migration Risks:**
1. Phased rollout (staging gate first, then tag-based releases)
2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing preview workflow
3. Comprehensive testing of new workflows before enabling
4. Detailed runbook for new deployment process
5. Team training sessions

## 15. Recommendations

### 15.1 Immediate Actions (Week 1)

**CRITICAL (Do First):**
1. ✅ **Configure AUTH0_AUDIENCE** in Render production environment
