# üîí CSRF Protection - Production Deployment Plan

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**PR**: #49 (MERGED)
**Merge Commit**: b11fea4f631fff0086033121916116cbb33b5e7c
**Status**: ‚úÖ MERGED TO MAIN - READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
**Security Level**: CRITICAL FIX #4
**Business Impact**: Protects ¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity

---

## Executive Summary

CSRF protection has been successfully merged to the main branch and is ready for production deployment. The implementation uses a kill-switch strategy (CSRF_ENABLED=False by default) to enable safe, phased rollout with instant rollback capability.

### Merge Details

- **Merged At**: 2025-10-01T09:51:26Z
- **Merged By**: zebra-devops
- **Strategy**: Squash merge (clean single commit)
- **Files Changed**: 14 files
- **Lines Added**: 2,139
- **Test Coverage**: 95%

### CI/CD Status (Post-Merge)

| Workflow | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CI Build | ‚úÖ PASS | All builds successful |
| Claude Code Review | ‚úÖ PASS | LOW RISK, PRODUCTION READY |
| Zebra Backend Auth (Bypass) | ‚úÖ PASS | Backend authentication verified |
| Database Migration Test | ‚ö†Ô∏è FAIL | Not blocking (CSRF has no migrations) |
| Zebra Full Smoke Test | ‚ö†Ô∏è FAIL | Frontend routing issues (pre-existing) |

**Assessment**: Safe to deploy. Failed checks are unrelated to CSRF implementation.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Double-Submit Cookie Pattern
- **Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure 64-character tokens
- **Storage**: Secure httpOnly cookie + frontend-accessible token
- **Validation**: Constant-time comparison (timing attack resistant)
- **Scope**: Protects POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations

### 2. Kill-Switch Deployment
- **Default State**: CSRF_ENABLED=False (protection disabled)
- **Activation**: Set CSRF_ENABLED=True after smoke testing
- **Rollback**: Instant (<30 seconds) via environment variable

### 3. Timing Attack Resistance
- **Implementation**: secrets.compare_digest() for token comparison
- **Stress Test**: 50 parallel requests with <1.5x variance
- **Verification**: Automated timing test suite included

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Breaking Changes**: ZERO
- **Frontend Changes**: Automatic X-CSRF-Token header injection
- **Legacy Support**: Graceful handling of missing tokens (when disabled)

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Deploy Disabled (5-Minute Smoke Test)

**Objective**: Verify application stability with CSRF code present but inactive

```bash
# 1. Verify environment configuration
echo "CSRF_ENABLED=False" >> .env  # or set in hosting platform

# 2. Deploy to production (auto-deploy from main branch)
# Render.com will auto-deploy commit b11fea4

# 3. Wait for deployment completion (check Render dashboard)

# 4. Run smoke tests
curl https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/health
curl -X POST https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test@zebra.associates","password":"test123"}'

# 5. Monitor for 5 minutes
# - Check error rates (should be unchanged)
# - Verify login/logout working
# - Test admin panel access
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200
- ‚úÖ Login/logout functioning normally
- ‚úÖ No new errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Response times unchanged

### Phase 2: Enable CSRF Protection (After Smoke Test Passes)

**Objective**: Activate CSRF protection after verifying deployment stability

```bash
# Option A: Using deployment script (RECOMMENDED)
cd /Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge
./scripts/deployment/csrf-enable.sh

# Option B: Manual activation
# 1. Set environment variable in hosting platform
#    Render.com: Environment > CSRF_ENABLED=True > Save Changes
# 2. Restart service (or auto-restarts on env change)
# 3. Verify activation
curl -I https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/csrf-token
# Should return: X-CSRF-Token-Required: true

# 4. Test protected endpoint
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/csrf-token)
curl -X POST https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"flag_name":"test","enabled":false}'
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ CSRF tokens generated at `/api/v1/auth/csrf-token`
- ‚úÖ Protected endpoints require X-CSRF-Token header
- ‚úÖ Requests without token return 403 Forbidden
- ‚úÖ Requests with valid token succeed

### Phase 3: Monitor for 15 Minutes

**Objective**: Verify production stability under real traffic with CSRF enabled

```bash
# 1. Monitor error rates
# - Check application logs for CSRF-related errors
# - Verify no legitimate requests being blocked

# 2. Test user workflows
# - Super admin login (matt.lindop@zebra.associates)
# - Feature flag management
# - Organization switching
# - Dashboard access

# 3. Check performance metrics
# - Response time impact (should be minimal)
# - CPU/memory usage (should be unchanged)
# - Error rates (should remain baseline)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ No increase in error rates
- ‚úÖ All user workflows functioning
- ‚úÖ Performance impact <10ms per request
- ‚úÖ No customer complaints

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Instant Rollback (<30 Seconds)

If critical issues discovered:

```bash
# Option 1: Disable CSRF (recommended for non-breaking issues)
# Set CSRF_ENABLED=False in hosting platform
# Service auto-restarts, protection disabled
# Application continues functioning normally

# Option 2: Revert commit (for critical bugs)
git revert b11fea4f631fff0086033121916116cbb33b5e7c
git push origin main
# Auto-deploy reverts CSRF implementation
```

### Rollback Triggers

Immediate rollback if:
- ‚ùå Login/logout failures spike >5%
- ‚ùå Admin panel access blocked
- ‚ùå Response times increase >100ms
- ‚ùå Customer reports of blocked requests
- ‚ùå Error rates increase >2x baseline
