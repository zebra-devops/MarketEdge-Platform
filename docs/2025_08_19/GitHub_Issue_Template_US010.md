## Issue Title
**US-010: Production B2B Email Infrastructure Setup and Environment Configuration**

## Issue Description

### Story Statement
**As a** Platform Administrator  
**I want** production-ready B2B outbound email infrastructure configured with proper environment variables  
**So that** new user invitation emails are reliably delivered to enterprise clients during onboarding processes

### Business Context
- **Revenue Impact:** ¬£925K+ enterprise segment requires reliable client onboarding email delivery
- **Current Blocker:** Email functionality implemented but production infrastructure not configured
- **Risk:** Failed email delivery breaks sub-24 hour onboarding commitment to enterprise clients
- **Dependencies:** Required for US-001, US-002, US-003 client onboarding capabilities

### Problem Statement
While B2B outbound email functionality is fully implemented in `/backend/app/services/auth.py:174-250`, the production email infrastructure and environment variables are not configured. This represents a critical deployment blocker for enterprise client onboarding.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Email code implementation complete
- ‚ùå Production SMTP configuration missing
- ‚ùå Environment variables not configured
- ‚ùå Email deliverability not tested
- ‚ùå Monitoring and alerting not setup

   - Setup DKIM records provided by SendGrid
   - Implement DMARC policy for domain protection
   - Validate DNS propagation

### **Phase 2: Environment Configuration (Day 2-3)**
1. **Secret Management Setup**
   - Configure AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent
   - Store SMTP credentials securely
   - Setup environment-specific configurations
   - Implement credential rotation procedures

2. **Application Configuration**
   - Deploy environment variables to production
   - Update staging and development environments
   - Validate configuration loading
   - Test environment-specific behavior

### **Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Day 4-5)**
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Execute email delivery tests across providers
   - Perform load testing with realistic scenarios
   - Validate security configurations
   - Test monitoring and alerting systems

2. **Production Validation**

## Comments

**Business Priority Justification:**
This infrastructure setup is a critical deployment blocker for the entire enterprise client onboarding capability. Without reliable email delivery, the ¬£925K+ revenue opportunity cannot be realized, making this a P0 priority for Phase 1 completion.

**Technical Implementation Note:**
The email functionality code is already implemented and tested. This story focuses purely on production infrastructure setup and configuration, making it lower risk than new feature development.

**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points based on infrastructure setup complexity and testing requirements, but with clear definition of done and established procedures.
