- **Industry Configuration Testing** - Ensure industry templates don't leak data between organizations

### Technical Architecture Requirements

#### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- Location management tables
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organisation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organisations(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    region_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User location access management
CREATE TABLE user_location_access (
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    location_id UUID REFERENCES locations(id),
    access_level access_level_enum,
    granted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    granted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, location_id)
);

-- Enhanced RLS policies
CREATE POLICY location_based_access ON competitive_intelligence...
```

#### API Architecture Enhancements
```python
# Industry configuration system
class IndustryTemplate:
    sic_code_mapping: Dict[str, str]
    default_roles: List[UserRole]
    dashboard_config: DashboardConfiguration
    feature_flags: FeatureConfiguration

# Organization creation with industry config
