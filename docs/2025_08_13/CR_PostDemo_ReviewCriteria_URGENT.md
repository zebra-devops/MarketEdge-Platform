## REVIEW WORKFLOW COORDINATION

### **Phase 3A Expedited Process (4-Hour Cycle)**
1. **Immediate Review Trigger:** Upon Software Developer completion notification
2. **Critical Issue Resolution:** Real-time feedback for blocking issues
3. **Quality Gate Validation:** All Phase 3A criteria met before production deployment
4. **Security Approval:** Enterprise security compliance validated and documented

### **Phase 3B Standard Process (24-Hour Cycle)**  
1. **Feature Review:** Competitive intelligence functionality validation
2. **Performance Testing:** Dashboard and data pipeline performance verification
3. **Business Logic Review:** Revenue impact calculations and industry metrics validation
4. **Integration Testing:** End-to-end workflow validation for cinema use cases

### **Cross-Phase Dependencies**
- **API Foundation:** Phase 3A API reliability must be stable before Phase 3B data integration
- **Security Model:** Phase 3A security implementation extends to competitive data protection
- **Permission Framework:** Phase 3A permissions enable proper competitive intelligence access control

## ESCALATION PROCEDURES

### **4-Hour Review Escalation**
If critical issues prevent Phase 3A approval within 4 hours:
- **Escalate to Technical Architect:** For architectural guidance on complex fixes
- **Parallel Development:** Consider temporary solutions to unblock demo environment
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate impact on demo and post-demo client onboarding

### **Quality vs. Timeline Conflicts**
- **P0 Issues:** Security or data integrity issues require resolution regardless of timeline
