## SPRINT CAPACITY PLANNING METHODOLOGY

### Development Team Assumptions
**Primary Development Resources:**
- 1 Senior Developer (8 hours/day capacity)
- 1 Junior Developer (6-7 hours/day capacity)
- 1 QA Engineer (8 hours/day capacity)

**Sprint Planning Principles:**
- **Velocity-Based Planning:** Historical team velocity with 20% buffer for unknown complexities
- **Business Value Optimization:** Maximum revenue impact per story point
- **Risk Mitigation:** Parallel development tracks where possible
- **Quality First:** QA validation integrated throughout, not just at sprint end

### Story Point Estimation Framework
**Story Point Scale (Fibonacci):**
- **1 Point:** Simple configuration/UI changes (2-4 hours)
- **2 Points:** Straightforward feature implementation (1 day)
- **3 Points:** Moderate complexity with some integration (1.5 days)
- **5 Points:** Complex feature requiring multiple components (2-3 days)
- **8 Points:** Large feature requiring significant architecture work (3-5 days)
