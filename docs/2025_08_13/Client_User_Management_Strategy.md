## 3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Multi-Tenant Database Architecture Enhancement

#### **Row-Level Security (RLS) Expansion**
```sql
-- Enhanced organization-based RLS for complex hierarchies
CREATE POLICY org_hierarchy_access ON competitive_intelligence
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  organisation_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid
  OR EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_location_access ula
    WHERE ula.user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::uuid
    AND ula.location_id = competitive_intelligence.location_id
  )
);
```

#### **Hierarchical Permission Model**
```python
class UserLocationAccess(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_location_access"
    
    user_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    location_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("locations.id"))
    permission_level: Mapped[PermissionLevel] = mapped_column(Enum(PermissionLevel))
    granted_by: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("users.id"))
    expires_at: Mapped[Optional[datetime]] = mapped_column(DateTime)
```

### API Architecture for Multi-Tenant Client Management

#### **Organization Context Middleware Enhancement**
```python
async def enhanced_tenant_context(request: Request, call_next):
    """Enhanced tenant context supporting location-based access control"""
    org_context = await extract_organization_context(request)
    user_context = await extract_user_permissions(request)
    
    # Set database context for RLS
    await set_database_context(
        org_id=org_context.organization_id,
        user_id=user_context.user_id,
        location_access=user_context.location_permissions
    )
    
    return await call_next(request)
```

#### **Client Onboarding API Endpoints**
```python
@router.post("/api/v1/admin/organizations")
async def create_organization(
    org_data: OrganizationCreate,
    industry_config: IndustryConfigRequest,
    current_user: SuperAdmin = Depends(require_super_admin)
) -> OrganizationResponse:
    """One-click organization creation with industry configuration"""
    
    # Create organization with industry defaults
    organization = await create_organization_with_defaults(org_data, industry_config)
    
    # Setup industry-specific competitive intelligence dashboard
    await setup_industry_dashboard(organization.id, industry_config.sic_code)
    
    # Configure rate limiting and subscription features
    await configure_subscription_features(organization.id, org_data.subscription_tier)
    
    return OrganizationResponse.from_orm(organization)
```

### User Management Service Architecture

#### **Permission Resolution Engine**
```python
class PermissionResolver:
    """Hierarchical permission resolution for complex organizations"""
    
    async def resolve_user_permissions(
        self, 
        user_id: uuid.UUID, 
        resource_type: str, 
        resource_id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = None
    ) -> PermissionSet:
        """Resolve effective permissions for user on specific resource"""
        
        # Get direct user permissions
        direct_permissions = await self.get_direct_permissions(user_id)
        
        # Get inherited permissions from organizational hierarchy
        inherited_permissions = await self.get_inherited_permissions(user_id)
        
        # Get location-based permissions if applicable
        location_permissions = await self.get_location_permissions(user_id, resource_id)
        
        return self.merge_permissions(
            direct_permissions, 
            inherited_permissions, 
            location_permissions
        )
```

### Industry Configuration System

#### **Dynamic Industry Templates**
```python
class IndustryTemplateService:
    """Industry-specific configuration and user role templates"""
    
    async def setup_industry_organization(
        self, 
        org_id: uuid.UUID, 
        industry: Industry
    ) -> OrganizationSetup:
        """Setup organization with industry-specific defaults"""
        
        # Load industry template
        template = await self.get_industry_template(industry)
        
        # Create default user roles for industry
        await self.create_industry_user_roles(org_id, template.user_roles)
        
        # Configure industry-specific dashboard
        await self.setup_industry_dashboard(org_id, template.dashboard_config)
        
        # Setup competitive intelligence data sources
        await self.configure_industry_data_sources(org_id, template.data_sources)
        
        return OrganizationSetup(
            organization_id=org_id,
            industry=industry,
            features_enabled=template.features,
            dashboard_configured=True
