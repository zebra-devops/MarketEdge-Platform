       # Review calculations for accuracy and demo effectiveness
       return {
           "pricing_opportunities": [...],  # Must be realistic
           "projected_revenue_impact": {...},  # Must demonstrate measurable value
           "competitive_positioning": {...}  # Must show market intelligence
       }
   ```

3. **API Documentation and Examples Validation**
   ```python
   # Review: OpenAPI documentation completeness
   @router.get("/competitors",
              summary="London West End Cinema Competitive Analysis",
              response_model=CompetitorAnalysis,
              examples={...})  # Must include working examples for client evaluation
   ```

   ```python
   # Review: Error responses suitable for client evaluation
   @app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
   async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
       # Must return professional error messages, not development stack traces
       return {"error": "Professional message", "support_contact": "..."}
   ```

2. **Performance Requirements Validation**
   ```python
   # Review: Response time optimization
   # Target: <200ms for API endpoints, <3s for dashboard loads
