# Epic: Standardize Data Fetching with TanStack Query

**Labels:** `epic`, `enhancement`, `frontend`, `technical-debt`, `react-query`
**Milestone:** Q1 2025 - React Query Standardization
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 89 (total for all child stories)

---

## Epic Overview

**Business Value:**
Standardize the frontend data fetching architecture to use TanStack Query (React Query) across 100% of components, eliminating inconsistent manual state management patterns. This will improve developer velocity, reduce bugs, enhance performance, and provide a better end-user experience through automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates.

**Current State:**
- ✅ 30% of components use React Query (feature flags)
- ⚠️ 70% use legacy manual `useState` + `useEffect` + `apiService` patterns
- Inconsistent developer experience and maintenance burden

**Target State:**
- ✅ 100% of data fetching uses React Query
- ✅ All CRUD operations use mutations with optimistic updates
- ✅ Smart caching strategy across all data types
- ✅ Improved performance metrics (60% fewer API calls, 40% less boilerplate)

**Success Metrics:**
- Code coverage: 100% of API calls use React Query hooks
- Performance: 60% reduction in API call volume
- Developer experience: 40% reduction in data fetching boilerplate
- User experience: 300-500ms faster navigation times
- Bug reduction: Eliminate race conditions and stale data issues

## Sub-Epics in this Initiative

- [ ] Epic #2: Admin Panel Query Migration (Priority 1)
- [ ] Epic #3: Implement Mutations and Optimistic Updates (Priority 2)
- [ ] Epic #4: Optimize Caching and Performance (Priority 3)

---

## Timeline

**Total Duration:** 6 weeks
**Phase 1:** Admin Panel Migration (Weeks 1-2)
**Phase 2:** Mutations Implementation (Weeks 3-4)
**Phase 3:** Optimization & Refinement (Weeks 5-6)

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Epic Completion

- [ ] All admin components migrated to React Query
- [ ] All user management operations use mutations
- [ ] All organization management operations use mutations
- [ ] Query key factory patterns documented
- [ ] Custom hook patterns established and documented
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (60% API reduction, 300ms+ faster navigation)
- [ ] Integration tests passing for all migrated components
- [ ] Developer documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to production and verified

---

## Dependencies

- Next.js 14.0.4 with React 18
- TanStack Query v3.39.3 (already installed)
- Existing `apiService` infrastructure
- Auth0 authentication system
- Multi-tenant organization context

---

## Technical Notes

**Complexity:** Complex (spans 6 weeks, multiple sub-epics)
**Agent Path:** dev → cr → qa-orch → devops
**Risk Level:** Medium (well-understood technology, incremental migration)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. Keep existing `apiService` as fetch mechanism
2. Use query key factory pattern for consistency
3. Implement optimistic updates for all mutations
4. Maintain backward compatibility during migration
5. Migrate incrementally (admin → application data → optimization)

---

## Rollout Strategy

**Week 1-2:** Admin Panel (high value, contained scope)
**Week 3-4:** Mutations (foundation for optimistic updates)
**Week 5-6:** Optimization (caching, prefetching, polish)

**Feature Flag:** Not required (internal refactor, transparent to users)
**Rollback Plan:** Keep manual patterns until migration verified, can revert individual components

## Comments

This epic represents a significant technical investment with immediate ROI. The feature flag implementation already demonstrates the benefits of React Query - we're extending these benefits to the entire application.

**Business Impact:**
- Faster feature development (less boilerplate)
- Fewer production bugs (automatic state management)
- Better user experience (instant navigation with cached data)
- Improved scalability (efficient caching reduces server load)
