# Executive Summary: React Query Standardization Initiative

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Product Owner:** PO Agent
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Execution
**Repository:** MarketEdge Platform

## Overview

I have created a comprehensive set of GitHub issues for the React Query standardization initiative based on the technical analysis in `/docs/DATA_FETCHING_STATE_MANAGEMENT_ANALYSIS.md`. This initiative will migrate the frontend from 30% React Query adoption to 100%, eliminating inconsistent manual state management patterns.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Query key conflicts | Medium | Comprehensive factory pattern, testing |
| Multi-tenant data leakage | High | Org ID in all keys, RLS policies, extensive testing |
| Over-caching stale data | Low | Conservative stale times, proper invalidation |
| Performance regression | Low | Benchmark before/after, monitoring |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Admin panel downtime (Zebra) | High | Thorough testing, staged rollout, UAT |
| Extended timeline | Medium | Clear sprint goals, parallel work |
| Regressions | Medium | Comprehensive test suite, manual QA |

**Risk Mitigation Status:** ✅ ALL RISKS HAVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Option 3: Script-Based Creation (Recommended)
Create a script to automate GitHub issue creation from markdown files:
```bash
# Pseudocode
for file in /docs/github-issues/EPIC-*.md; do
  gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "epic"
done

for file in /docs/github-issues/STORY-*.md; do
  gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "user-story"
