## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|

| Multi-tenant data leakage | High | Include org ID in all query keys, RLS policies, extensive testing |
| Over-caching stale data | Low | Conservative stale times, proper invalidation strategies |
| Performance regression | Low | Benchmark before/after, monitor in production |
| Breaking changes during migration | Medium | Incremental migration, feature flags, rollback plan |
