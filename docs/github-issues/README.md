## Initiative Overview

### The Problem
- **Current State:** 30% React Query, 70% manual state management
- **Issues:** Inconsistent patterns, boilerplate code, no caching, race conditions
- **Impact:** Slow navigation, redundant API calls, poor developer experience

### The Solution
- **Target State:** 100% React Query adoption
- **Approach:** 3 sprints over 6 weeks (admin → mutations → optimization)
- **Outcome:** 60% fewer API calls, instant navigation, optimistic updates

### Business Impact
- **Performance:** 300-500ms faster navigation
- **Developer Velocity:** 40% less boilerplate, 30% faster development
- **User Experience:** Instant UI updates, offline support
- **Infrastructure:** Reduced server load from fewer API calls
- **Zebra Associates:** Improved admin dashboard for £925K opportunity

## Creating GitHub Issues

### Option 1: Manual Creation
Copy content from markdown files to GitHub:

4. Link stories to Epic #2
5. Apply labels and story points

### Option 2: Script-Based (Recommended)
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (gh)
for epic in docs/github-issues/EPIC-*.md; do
  gh issue create --title "..." --body "$(cat $epic)" --label "epic"
done

for story in docs/github-issues/STORY-*.md; do
  gh issue create --title "..." --body "$(cat $story)" --label "user-story"
done
```

### Option 3: QA-Orch Automation
