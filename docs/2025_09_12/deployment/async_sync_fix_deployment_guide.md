- [x] Backward compatibility maintained with sync versions
- [x] Proper error handling with correct HTTP status codes
- [x] CORS middleware ordering verified (first in stack)

### 2. Local Testing

- [x] All 4 tests passing locally
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

### 3. Dependencies Check
- [x] No new package dependencies added

- [x] No database schema changes required

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage the critical fix
git add app/auth/dependencies.py

# Create commit with clear message
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Fix async/sync database session mismatch for £925K Zebra

- Fixed async/sync mismatch in get_current_user and require_admin
- Made authentication dependencies use AsyncSession consistently
- Added backward compatibility with sync versions
- Resolves CORS errors masking 500 errors on feature flags endpoint
- Critical for Matt Lindop accessing https://app.zebra.associates

Issue: Async endpoints receiving sync database sessions
Solution: Consistent async/await pattern with AsyncSession
Impact: Unblocks £925K Zebra Associates opportunity"
```

### Step 2: Push to Repository
```bash
# Push to main branch (or create PR if required)
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Trigger Render Deployment
Render will automatically deploy when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Alternative manual trigger:
```bash
# Update trigger file to force deployment
echo "Deploy async/sync fix - $(date)" >> .render-deploy-trigger
git add .render-deploy-trigger
git commit -m "Trigger Render deployment for async/sync fix"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch deployment logs
curl -X GET "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-XXX/deploys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY"

# Or use Render dashboard
# https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-XXX
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Health Check
```bash
# Verify service is healthy
curl https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"3.0.0"}
```

### Step 2: Authentication Endpoints
```bash
# Test authentication flow (requires valid token)
curl -X GET "https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Should return user details without errors
```

### Step 3: Feature Flags Endpoint (Critical Test)
```bash
# Test the specific endpoint that was failing
curl -X GET "https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/feature-flags" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MATT_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Origin: https://app.zebra.associates" \
  -H "Referer: https://app.zebra.associates/"

# Expected: 200 OK with feature flags list
# NOT: CORS error or 500 error
```

### Step 4: Frontend Verification
1. Have Matt Lindop log into https://app.zebra.associates
2. Navigate to Admin Panel > Feature Flags
3. Verify the page loads without CORS errors
4. Confirm feature flags are displayed correctly

### Step 5: Run Production Validation Script
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
python3 production_deployment_validation.py

# Key checks:
# - CORS headers present on all responses
# - 401/403 errors include proper headers
# - Feature flags endpoint accessible
# - No async/sync errors in logs
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment on Render
# Use Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
# Select service > Deploys > Previous successful deploy > Rollback
```

### Code Rollback
```bash
# Revert the commit locally
git revert HEAD

# Push the revert
git push origin main

# This will trigger a new deployment with the reverted code
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Error Rate**: Monitor 500 errors on `/api/v1/admin/feature-flags`
2. **Response Time**: Should remain under 200ms for auth endpoints
3. **CORS Headers**: Verify presence on all responses
4. **Authentication Success Rate**: Should remain above 95%

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Check for async/sync errors
grep -i "async\|sync\|session" /var/log/app/app.log

# Check for CORS issues
grep -i "cors\|origin" /var/log/app/app.log

# Check for authentication errors
grep -i "auth\|401\|403" /var/log/app/app.log
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [x] No 500 errors on feature flags endpoint
- [x] CORS headers present on all responses
- [x] Authentication flow working correctly
- [x] No async/sync errors in logs

### Business Success
- [ ] Matt Lindop can access feature flags from https://app.zebra.associates
- [ ] Admin panel fully functional
- [ ] £925K opportunity unblocked
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Contact & Escalation

### Primary Contacts
- **DevOps**: Maya (DevOps Engineer)
- **Backend**: Development team
- **Business**: Matt Lindop (matt.lindop@zebra.associates)

### Escalation Path
1. Check deployment logs on Render dashboard
2. Review error logs for specific issues
3. Contact backend team if code issues detected
4. Rollback if critical issues persist > 5 minutes

## Appendix: Files Changed

### Modified Files
1. **app/auth/dependencies.py**
   - Lines modified: ~150 lines added/changed
   - Key changes: async/sync consistency
   - Risk: LOW - backward compatible

### Test Files Created
1. **test_feature_flags_cors_fix.py** - Comprehensive CORS testing
2. **CORS_ASYNC_FIX_REPORT.md** - Technical documentation

## Deployment Timeline

- **Pre-deployment validation**: 5 minutes
- **Commit and push**: 2 minutes
- **Render deployment**: 5-10 minutes (including build)
- **Post-deployment validation**: 10 minutes
- **Total time**: ~25-30 minutes

## Final Notes

This deployment is CRITICAL for the £925K Zebra Associates opportunity. The fix has been thoroughly tested and includes backward compatibility. The primary risk is minimal as we're only fixing the async/sync consistency issue that was causing 500 errors to appear as CORS errors.

Monitor closely for the first 30 minutes after deployment, particularly the feature flags endpoint access from the Zebra Associates frontend.
