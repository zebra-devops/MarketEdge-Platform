## Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables Set

**Critical Configuration:**
- API Backend: `https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com`
- Auth0 Domain: `dev-g8trhgbfdq2sk2m8.us.auth0.com`
- Auth0 Client ID: `9FRjf82esKN4fx3iY337CT1jpvNVFbAP`
- Redirect URI: `https://staging.zebra.associates/api/auth/callback`

**Feature Flags Enabled:**
- Epic 1: ‚úÖ Enabled
- Epic 2: ‚úÖ Enabled
- Debug Mode: ‚úÖ Enabled

---

## Critical Next Steps

### üî¥ REQUIRED - Auth0 Configuration

**Action:** Configure Auth0 application settings before user testing

**Required Settings in Auth0 Dashboard:**

1. **Allowed Callback URLs:**
   ```
   https://staging.zebra.associates/api/auth/callback
   https://staging.zebra.associates/callback
   ```

2. **Allowed Logout URLs:**
   ```
   https://staging.zebra.associates
   https://staging.zebra.associates/login
   ```

3. **Allowed Web Origins:**
   ```
   https://staging.zebra.associates
   ```

4. **Allowed Origins (CORS):**
   ```
   https://staging.zebra.associates
   https://marketedge-platform-staging.onrender.com
   ```

**Without these settings, authentication will not work.**

## Testing Readiness

### ‚úÖ Ready for Testing
- Frontend deployment
- Backend connectivity
- Database connection
- API endpoints
- SSL/HTTPS security

### ‚è≥ Pending Configuration
- Auth0 callback URLs (see above)
- User authentication flow
- Multi-tenant context switching
- Feature flag validation

---

## Known Limitations

### Staging Environment Characteristics

1. **Cold Start Delay**
   - First request after inactivity: ~2-3 seconds
   - Expected behavior for Render staging tier
   - Acceptable for staging environment

2. **Redis Degraded Status**
   - Backend reports Redis as "degraded"
   - Session management falls back to database
   - Acceptable for staging environment

3. **Free Tier Limitations**
   - Render staging uses free tier
   - May sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Consider upgrading for production
