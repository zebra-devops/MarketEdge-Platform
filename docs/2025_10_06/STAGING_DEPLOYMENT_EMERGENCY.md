# STAGING DEPLOYMENT EMERGENCY - Code Not Deploying

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Issue:** Staging service still running old code with psycopg2 error despite new code pushed
**Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL - Deployment pipeline broken

---

## VERIFICATION COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Code is Correctly on Staging Branch
```
Current staging branch commit: 3396375
Remote staging branch commit: 3396375
Status: ✅ LOCAL AND REMOTE IN SYNC
```

### 2. Diagnostic Code is Present
```bash
$ grep -n "DATABASE-INIT\|SCHEME-FIX" app/core/database.py
54: [DATABASE-INIT] Starting database initialization, DATABASE_URL scheme: {original_scheme}
78: [SCHEME-FIX] original={original_scheme} async={async_scheme}
79: [SCHEME-FIX-DETAILS] Transformation applied: {original_scheme} -> {async_scheme}
```

### 3. render.yaml Configuration is Correct
```yaml
name: marketedge-platform-staging
runtime: python
branch: staging  # ✅ Configured to deploy from staging branch
startCommand: ./render-startup.sh  # ✅ Using startup script, not Dockerfile
```

### 4. Recent Commits Confirm Fix is Present
```
3396375 fix: add diagnostic logging to verify async driver scheme transformation
fbeec3b feat: add staging deployment monitoring script
a1ee04d feat: enhance staging verification script with database status check
229c90e docs: add staging deployment verification checklist with postgres:// fix details

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS 🔍

**The code is correct and pushed. The deployment is NOT pulling the new code.**

### Most Likely Causes (in order of probability):

#### 1. **Render Dashboard Branch Mismatch** (90% likely)
- Service was created manually (not from blueprint)
- Dashboard branch setting overrides render.yaml
- Service may be deploying from `main` instead of `staging`

#### 2. **Build Cache is Serving Stale Code** (5% likely)
- Render cached a broken build
- New deployments using cached layers

#### 3. **Deployment Not Actually Triggered** (5% likely)
- Auto-deploy disabled
- Manual deploy required

---

## IMMEDIATE FIX INSTRUCTIONS 🔧

### Fix Option A: Verify and Correct Branch in Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

**Execute these steps in Render Dashboard:**

1. **Navigate to Staging Service**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find service: `marketedge-platform-staging`

2. **Check Current Branch Setting**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Look for "Branch" under "Build & Deploy"
   - **EXPECTED:** `staging`
   - **IF DIFFERENT:** This is the root cause

3. **Correct the Branch**
   - Change "Branch" to: `staging`
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - This will trigger automatic redeployment

4. **Verify Auto-Deploy is Enabled**
   - Under "Build & Deploy" → "Auto-Deploy"
   - **MUST BE:** ✅ Enabled
   - If disabled, enable it

5. **Force Clear Build Cache**
   - Click "Manual Deploy" button
   - Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - This ensures fresh build from staging branch

---

### Fix Option B: Force Rebuild from CLI (IF OPTION A DOESN'T WORK)

If you have Render CLI installed:

```bash
# Force redeploy with cache clear
render deploy --service marketedge-platform-staging --branch staging --clear-cache
```

---

### Fix Option C: Empty Commit Force Push (LAST RESORT)

Only if Options A and B fail:

```bash
# Create empty commit to force new deployment
git checkout staging
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: force rebuild - emergency deployment fix"
git push origin staging --force-with-lease

# Then in Render Dashboard:
# Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy
```

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✅

After applying fix, verify deployment worked:

### 1. Check Render Deploy Logs for Diagnostic Messages

**Look for these EXACT log lines:**
```
[DATABASE-INIT] Starting database initialization, DATABASE_URL scheme: postgres
[SCHEME-FIX] original=postgres async=postgresql+asyncpg
[SCHEME-FIX-DETAILS] Transformation applied: postgres -> postgresql+asyncpg
```

**If you see these logs:** ✅ New code is deployed!
**If you DON'T see these logs:** ❌ Still running old code

### 2. Check for psycopg2 Error

**Old error (should NOT appear):**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- No psycopg2 error
- Diagnostic logs showing scheme transformation
- Database connection successful with asyncpg driver

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Use the monitoring script:
```bash
cd /Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge
./scripts/monitor-staging-deployment.sh
```

This will check:
- Service status
- Recent logs
- Database connectivity
- Health endpoint

---

## DIAGNOSIS COMMANDS 🔬

### Check What Render is Actually Deploying

```bash
# Check commit SHA in Render logs
# Look for line like: "Starting build for commit 3396375..."

# Compare with expected SHA:
git rev-parse origin/staging
# Expected: 339637588a09c00077e7512cf4498aaf31760842
```

### Verify render.yaml is Being Used

If service was created manually (not from blueprint), render.yaml settings are **IGNORED**.

**To check:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Service Settings
2. Look for "Created from Blueprint" indicator
3. If NOT from blueprint, must manually configure all settings in dashboard

---

## EXPECTED SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT LOGS 📋

When deployment succeeds, you should see:

```
[Build Output]
Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
Successfully installed asyncpg==0.29.0 psycopg2-binary==2.9.9 sqlalchemy==2.0.23

[Startup Logs]
🚀 MarketEdge Platform Starting...
🔧 Environment: staging
🔄 STAGING/PREVIEW ENVIRONMENT DETECTED
[DATABASE-INIT] Starting database initialization, DATABASE_URL scheme: postgres
[SCHEME-FIX] original=postgres async=postgresql+asyncpg
[SCHEME-FIX-DETAILS] Transformation applied: postgres -> postgresql+asyncpg
✅ Schema validation passed
🟢 Starting FastAPI application...
Application startup complete.
```

**NO psycopg2 errors!**

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN 🔙

If fix causes issues:

```bash
# Revert to previous staging commit
git checkout staging
git reset --hard 8f54374  # Previous working commit
git push origin staging --force-with-lease

# In Render Dashboard:
# Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy
```

---

## PREVENTION - WHY THIS HAPPENED 🎓

**Manual Service Creation vs Blueprint Deployment:**

- **Blueprint Deployment:** render.yaml controls ALL settings (branch, environment, etc.)
- **Manual Service Creation:** Dashboard settings override render.yaml

**If staging service was created manually:**
- render.yaml `branch: staging` is **IGNORED**
- Must manually set branch in dashboard
- This is why code changes aren't deploying

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Delete manually-created staging service and recreate from render.yaml blueprint for proper IaC control.

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX ⏭️

Once deployment succeeds:

1. ✅ Verify diagnostic logs appear
2. ✅ Verify database connects with asyncpg
3. ✅ Test Auth0 authentication flow
4. ✅ Document final fix method used
5. 🔄 Apply same fix method to production when ready

---

## CONTACTS & ESCALATION 📞

**If all fixes fail:**
- Check Render Status: https://status.render.com
- Contact Render Support: https://render.com/support
- Provide this diagnostic report

**Critical Business Context:**
- £925K Zebra Associates opportunity depends on staging environment
- Staging validates Auth0 configuration before production deployment
- Timeline: Critical - immediate resolution required

## SUMMARY FOR USER 📊

**Problem Confirmed:**
- ✅ Code is correct and on staging branch (commit 3396375)
- ✅ Diagnostic logging present in code
- ✅ render.yaml configured correctly
- ❌ **Render is NOT deploying the new code**

**Most Likely Root Cause:**
- Render Dashboard branch setting is NOT set to `staging`
- Service created manually (not from blueprint)
- Dashboard settings override render.yaml

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard → marketedge-platform-staging → Settings
2. Verify "Branch" is set to `staging` (if not, change it)
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Monitor logs for `[DATABASE-INIT]` and `[SCHEME-FIX]` diagnostic messages

**Expected Resolution Time:** 5-10 minutes after branch correction
