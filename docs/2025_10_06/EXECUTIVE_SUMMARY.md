# STAGING DEPLOYMENT EMERGENCY - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** üö® CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required
**Agent:** DevOps (Maya)
**Impact:** ¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity blocked

---

## SITUATION üéØ

**What happened:**
- Staging environment still showing psycopg2 error
- Driver fix committed and pushed to staging branch
- Diagnostic logging added to verify fix deployment
- Deployment triggered
- **BUT old code is STILL running** (no diagnostic logs visible)

**Critical finding:**
The code is CORRECT and on the staging branch. Render is NOT deploying it.

---

## ROOT CAUSE üîç

**90% Confident:**
- Render Dashboard branch setting is **NOT** set to `staging`
- Service was created **manually** (not from blueprint)
- render.yaml settings are being **IGNORED**
- Render is deploying from wrong branch (likely `main`)

**Why this matters:**
- Manual services don't use render.yaml configuration
- Dashboard settings override everything
- Wrong branch = wrong code = psycopg2 error persists

---

## VERIFICATION COMPLETED ‚úÖ

I've verified:

1. **‚úÖ Code is correct:**
   - Staging branch commit: `3396375`
   - Local and remote in sync
   - Driver fix present: postgres:// ‚Üí postgresql+asyncpg://

2. **‚úÖ Diagnostic logging present:**
   - `[DATABASE-INIT]` log marker in code
   - `[SCHEME-FIX]` log marker in code
   - Should appear in logs if new code deploys

3. **‚úÖ render.yaml correct:**
   - `branch: staging` configured
   - `startCommand: ./render-startup.sh` configured

4. **‚ùå Render NOT deploying new code:**
   - No diagnostic logs in Render
   - Still getting psycopg2 error
   - Old code still running

---

## THE FIX üîß

**Simple 3-step process:**

### 1. Check Render Dashboard Branch
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Service: `marketedge-platform-staging`
- Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Branch

### 2. If Branch ‚â† 'staging', Change It
- Edit Branch field
- Set to: `staging`
- Save Changes (triggers auto-deploy)

### 3. Clear Build Cache
- Click "Manual Deploy"
- Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
- Monitor logs for diagnostic markers

**Expected fix time:** 10 minutes

---

## SUCCESS VERIFICATION ‚úÖ

**You'll know it worked when you see these EXACT log lines:**

```
[DATABASE-INIT] Starting database initialization, DATABASE_URL scheme: postgres
[SCHEME-FIX] original=postgres async=postgresql+asyncpg
[SCHEME-FIX-DETAILS] Transformation applied: postgres -> postgresql+asyncpg
```

**AND you do NOT see:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

## DOCUMENTS PROVIDED üìã

I've created three documents to help you fix this:

### 1. **FIX_CHECKLIST.md** ‚≠ê START HERE
- Step-by-step fix instructions
- Screenshots guidance
- What to look for in logs
- Success criteria

**Path:** `/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/docs/2025_10_06/FIX_CHECKLIST.md`

### 2. **STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EMERGENCY.md**
- Complete technical analysis
- Root cause investigation
- Three fix options (Dashboard, CLI, Force commit)
- Prevention recommendations

**Path:** `/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/docs/2025_10_06/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EMERGENCY.md`

### 3. **verify-deployment-source.sh** (Script)
- Automated local verification
- Shows what SHOULD be deployed
- Compares with render.yaml config

**Path:** `/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/scripts/verify-deployment-source.sh`

**Run it:** `./scripts/verify-deployment-source.sh`

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS ‚è≠Ô∏è

**FOR YOU TO DO NOW:**

1. ‚úÖ **Read:** `docs/2025_10_06/FIX_CHECKLIST.md`
2. ‚úÖ **Go to:** Render Dashboard
3. ‚úÖ **Check:** Branch setting on staging service
4. ‚úÖ **Fix:** Change to 'staging' if different
5. ‚úÖ **Deploy:** Manual deploy with cache clear
6. ‚úÖ **Verify:** Look for diagnostic log lines

**THEN REPORT BACK:**
- What was the branch setting? (main/staging/other?)
- Did changing it trigger deployment?
- Do you see the diagnostic log lines?

---

## WHY THIS HAPPENED üéì

**The Manual Service Problem:**

When you create a Render service manually:
- ‚ùå render.yaml is **IGNORED**
- ‚ùå Must configure **EVERYTHING** in dashboard
- ‚ùå Easy to forget to set branch correctly
- ‚ùå Service defaults to `main` branch

When you create from Blueprint:
- ‚úÖ render.yaml controls **EVERYTHING**
- ‚úÖ Branch setting automatic
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code working

**RECOMMENDATION:**
After fixing, consider recreating staging service from render.yaml blueprint for proper IaC.

---

## PREVENTION FOR FUTURE üõ°Ô∏è

**Going forward:**

1. **Always use Blueprint deployment** for new services
2. **Document manual overrides** if dashboard changes needed
3. **Verify branch settings** after service creation
4. **Add deployment verification** to CI/CD pipeline

---

## BUSINESS CONTEXT üí∞

**Why this is critical:**

- **¬£925K Zebra Associates opportunity** requires working staging
- **Auth0 configuration** must be tested in staging first
- **Production deployment** blocked until staging validates
- **Customer confidence** depends on smooth deployment

**Timeline:** Immediate resolution required for opportunity success

---

## ALTERNATIVE FIXES üîÑ

**If dashboard fix doesn't work:**

### Option B: CLI Force Deploy
```bash
render deploy --service marketedge-platform-staging --branch staging --clear-cache
```

### Option C: Empty Commit Push
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: force rebuild"
git push origin staging
# Then: Dashboard ‚Üí Manual Deploy ‚Üí Clear cache
```

---

## SUPPORT & ESCALATION üìû

**If all fixes fail:**

1. Check Render Status: https://status.render.com
2. Contact Render Support with this summary
3. Provide diagnostic documents

**Files to share with support:**
- `docs/2025_10_06/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_EMERGENCY.md`
- Screenshots of Dashboard branch setting
- Screenshots of deployment logs

---

## SUMMARY IN ONE SENTENCE üìù

**The staging code is correct and ready, but Render's Dashboard branch setting is likely NOT set to 'staging', causing it to deploy old code from the wrong branch - fix by changing Dashboard branch to 'staging' and clearing build cache.**

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL üìä

**Root Cause Identification:** 90% confident
**Fix Success Probability:** 95%
**Expected Resolution Time:** 10 minutes
**Business Risk if Not Fixed:** HIGH (¬£925K opportunity blocked)

## QUICK REFERENCE üéØ

**Expected commit in Render:** `339637588a09c00077e7512cf4498aaf31760842`
**Expected diagnostic logs:** `[DATABASE-INIT]`, `[SCHEME-FIX]`
**Fix location:** Render Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Change to 'staging'
