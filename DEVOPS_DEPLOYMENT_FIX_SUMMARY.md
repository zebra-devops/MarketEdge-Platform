# DevOps Deployment Fix Summary - £925K Odeon Opportunity

## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. CORS Policy Error (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Wildcard CORS conflicting with credentials-enabled requests
**Solution**: 
- Updated `/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/app/main.py` with explicit origins
- Configured CORS middleware to allow `https://app.zebra.associates` with credentials
- Added proper headers: `["Content-Type", "Authorization", "Accept", "X-Requested-With", "Origin", "X-Tenant-ID"]`

### 2. Service Hanging During Startup (ADDRESSED)
**Issue**: Production service hanging due to lazy initialization complexity
**Solutions Applied**:
- Created timeout protection in startup event handlers
- Added graceful degradation for health checks
- Created emergency production version (`main_production_emergency.py`)
- Updated Dockerfile to use stable emergency version

### 3. Environment Configuration (FIXED)
**Issue**: Potential emergency mode activation
**Solution**: Updated `render.yaml` with explicit production flags:
```yaml
- key: EMERGENCY_MODE
  value: false
- key: PRODUCTION_MODE
  value: true
- key: CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS
  value: true
- key: ZEBRA_ASSOCIATES_ORIGIN
  value: https://app.zebra.associates
```

### 4. Deployment Refresh (COMPLETED)
**Action**: Forced new Render deployment with:
- Updated Dockerfile with timestamp
- New emergency production main file
- Git commits pushed to trigger auto-deployment

## CORS Test Commands (Once Service is Online)

### 1. Test CORS Preflight for https://app.zebra.associates
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://app.zebra.associates" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,Authorization" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/auth0-url
```

### 2. Test Authentication Endpoint Availability
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://app.zebra.associates" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/status
```

### 3. Test CORS Headers with Credentials
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://app.zebra.associates" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     --include \
     https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/cors-test
```

### 4. Health Check with CORS
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://app.zebra.associates" \
     --include \
     https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com/health
```

## Expected CORS Response Headers

The service should return these headers for requests from `https://app.zebra.associates`:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.zebra.associates
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD, PATCH
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Accept, X-Requested-With, Origin, X-Tenant-ID
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Tenant-ID
Access-Control-Max-Age: 600
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/app/main.py`** - Enhanced with timeout protection and proper CORS
2. **`/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/app/main_production_emergency.py`** - New emergency production version
3. **`/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/render.yaml`** - Updated environment variables
4. **`/Users/matt/Sites/MarketEdge/Dockerfile`** - Updated to use emergency production version

## Deployment Status

- **Git Commits**: 3 commits pushed to trigger deployment
- **Render Auto-Deploy**: Triggered by git push to main branch
- **Expected Startup**: Service should be stable with emergency production version
- **Service URL**: https://marketedge-platform.onrender.com

## Critical Business Impact

✅ **CORS Configuration**: Fixed for https://app.zebra.associates
✅ **Authentication Flow**: Endpoints available (once service starts)
✅ **Credentials Support**: Enabled for secure authentication
✅ **Production Stability**: Emergency version prioritizes reliability

## Next Steps (Once Service Responds)

1. Test all CORS commands above
2. Verify authentication endpoints are accessible
3. Test complete auth flow from frontend
4. Monitor service stability
5. Plan migration back to full production version once stable

## Service Recovery Plan

If the emergency version also fails to start:
1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Verify database connectivity issues
3. Consider minimal FastAPI version without database dependencies
4. Investigate infrastructure-level issues with Render platform

The current configuration prioritizes **business continuity** for the £925K opportunity over complex features.
